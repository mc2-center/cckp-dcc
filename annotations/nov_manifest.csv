Moreover, epigenomic alterations can now be measured at multiple scales of analysis and are detectable in human tumors or liquid biopsies. Malignant cell clones with a proclivity for relapse in certain organs may arise in the primary tumor as a consequence of epigenomic alterations which cause a loss in lineage integrity. These alterations may occur due to genetic aberrations acquired during tumor progression or concomitant to therapeutic response. Moreover, evolution of the stroma can also alter the epigenome of cancer cells. In this review, we highlight current knowledge with a particular emphasis on leveraging chromatin and DNA modifying mechanisms as biomarkers of disseminated disease and as therapeutic targets to treat metastatic cancers.",Targeted Therapy Agent,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Appicable,Open Access

While mapping these relationships between TFs is important for understanding their context-specific functions, existing approaches either rely on DNA binding motif predictions, interrogate one TF at a time, or study individual TFs in parallel. Here, we introduce paired yeast one-hybrid (pY1H) assays to detect cooperativity and antagonism across hundreds of TF-pairs at DNA regions of interest. We provide evidence that a wide variety of TFs are subject to modulation by other TFs in a DNA region-specific manner. We also demonstrate that TF-TF relationships are often affected by alternative isoform usage and identify cooperativity and antagonism between human TFs and viral proteins from human papillomaviruses, Epstein-Barr virus, and other viruses. Altogether, pY1H assays provide a broadly applicable framework to study how different functional relationships affect protein occupancy at regulatory DNA regions.","DNA Sequencing, ChIP-Seq",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,PRJNA1015222,Open Access

We also combine these building blocks to create more complex fluidic controllers, such as timers and clocks.

Here, we used a systems biology approach to compare metabolic fluxes used by parental breast cancer cells and their brain- and lung-homing derivatives. Divergent lineages had distinct, heritable metabolic fluxes. Lung-homing cells maintained high glycolytic flux despite low levels of glycolytic intermediates, constitutively activating a pathway sink into lactate. This strong Warburg effect was associated with a high ratio of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) expression, which correlated with lung metastasis in patients with breast cancer. Although feature classification models trained on clinical characteristics alone were unable to predict tropism, the LDH/PDH ratio was a significant predictor of metastasis to the lung but not to other organs, independent of other transcriptomic signatures. High lactate efflux was also a trait in lung-homing metastatic pancreatic cancer cells, suggesting that lactate production may be a convergent phenotype in lung metastasis. Together, these analyses highlight the essential role that metabolism plays in organ-specific cancer metastasis and identify a putative biomarker for predicting lung metastasis in patients with breast cancer. Significance: Lung-homing metastatic breast cancer cells express an elevated ratio of lactate dehydrogenase to pyruvate dehydrogenase, indicating that ratios of specific metabolic gene transcripts have potential as metabolic biomarkers for predicting organ-specific metastasis.","Cell Culture, ELISA, Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry",Breast Neoplasm,Not Applicable,Not Appicable,Open Access

Cancer vaccines require the addition of immunostimulatory adjuvants to increase vaccine immunogenicity, and increasingly multiple adjuvants are used in combination to bolster further and shape cellular immunity to tumor antigens. However, rigorous quantification of adjuvants' synergistic interactions is challenging due to partial redundancy in costimulatory molecules and cytokine production, leading to the common assumption that combining both adjuvants at the maximum tolerated dose results in optimal efficacy. Herein, we examine this maximum dose assumption and find combinations of these doses are suboptimal. Instead, we optimized dendritic cell activation by extending the Multidimensional Synergy of Combinations (MuSyC) framework that measures the synergy of efficacy and potency between two vaccine adjuvants. Initially, we performed a preliminary <i>in vitro</i> screening of clinically translatable adjuvant receptor targets (TLR, STING, NLL, and RIG-I). We determined that STING agonist (CDN) plus TLR4 agonist (MPL-A) or TLR7/8 agonist (R848) as the best pairwise combinations for dendritic cell activation. In addition, we found that the combination of R848 and CDN is synergistically efficacious and potent in activating both murine and human antigen-presenting cells (APCs) <i>in vitro</i>. These two selected adjuvants were then used to estimate a MuSyC-dose optimized for <i>in vivo</i> T-cell priming using ovalbumin-based peptide vaccines. Finally, using B16 melanoma and MOC1 head and neck cancer models, MuSyC-dose-based adjuvating of cancer vaccines improved the antitumor response, increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and induced novel myeloid tumor infiltration changes. Further, the MuSyC-dose-based adjuvants approach did not cause additional weight changes or increased plasma cytokine levels compared to CDN alone. Collectively, our findings offer a proof of principle that our MuSyC-extended approach can be used to optimize cancer vaccine formulations for immunotherapy.","Flow Cytometry, In Vitro Cell Killing Assay","Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Melanoma, Acute Monocytic Leukemia",Not Applicable,Not Appicable,Open Access

Even in cancers driven by a single mutated oncogene, variability in response to targeted therapies is well known. The existence of additional genomic alterations among tumor cells can only partially explain this variability. As such, nongenetic factors are increasingly seen as critical contributors to tumor relapse and acquired resistance in cancer. Here, we show that both genetic and nongenetic factors contribute to targeted drug response variability in an experimental model of tumor heterogeneity. We observe significant variability to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition among and within multiple versions and clonal sublines of PC9, a commonly used EGFR mutant nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line. We resolve genetic, epigenetic, and stochastic components of this variability using a theoretical framework in which distinct genetic states give rise to multiple epigenetic ""basins of attraction,"" across which cells can transition driven by stochastic noise. Using mutational impact analysis, single-cell differential gene expression, and correlations among Gene Ontology (GO) terms to connect genomics to transcriptomics, we establish a baseline for genetic differences driving drug response variability among PC9 cell line versions. Applying the same approach to clonal sublines, we conclude that drug response variability in all but one of the sublines is due to epigenetic differences; in the other, it is due to genetic alterations. Finally, using a clonal drug response assay together with stochastic simulations, we attribute subclonal drug response variability within sublines to stochastic cell fate decisions and confirm that one subline likely contains genetic resistance mutations that emerged in the absence of drug treatment.","Cell Culture, Flow Cytometry, Immunohistochemistry Staining Method, RT-qPCR",Melanoma,Skin,"GSE150083, GSE150084, GSE150025",Open Access

In both scenarios, quantifying plasticity is essential for identifying high-plasticity states or elucidating transition paths between states. Currently, methods to quantify plasticity tend to focus on 1) quantification of quasi-potential based on the underlying gene regulatory network dynamics of the system; or 2) inference of cell potency based on trajectory inference or lineage tracing in single-cell dynamics.

One factor known to contribute to the poor chemotherapy response is the poor drug diffusion into PDAC tumors. Novel treatment methods are therefore drastically needed to improve targeted delivery of treatments. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of the 3DNA¬Æ Nanocarrier (3DNA) platform to direct delivery of therapeutics to PDAC tumors in vivo. Materials and methods: A panel of PDAC cell lines and a patient tissue microarray were screened for established tumor-specific proteins to identify targeting moieties for active targeting of the 3DNA. NRG mice with or without orthotopic MIA PaCa-2-luciferase PDAC tumors were treated intraperitoneally with 100 Œºl of fluorescently labeled 3DNA. Results: Folic acid and transferrin receptors were significantly elevated in PDAC compared to normal pancreas. Accordingly, both folic acid- and transferrin-conjugated 3DNA treatments significantly increased delivery of 3DNA specifically to tumors in comparison to unconjugated 3DNA treatment. In the absence of tumors, there was an increased clearance of both folic acid-conjugated 3DNA and unconjugated 3DNA, compared to the clearance rate in tumor-bearing mice. Lastly, delivery of siLuciferase by folic acid-conjugated 3DNA in an orthotopic model of luciferase-expressing PDAC showed significant and prolonged suppression of luciferase protein expression and activity. Conclusion: Our study progresses the 3DNA technology as a reliable and effective treatment delivery platform for targeted therapeutic approaches in PDAC.","Luciferase Reporter Assay, qPCR, Immunohistochemistry Staining Method",Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access

Here we show that most McSCs toggle between transit-amplifying and stem cell states for both self-renewal and generation of mature progeny, a mechanism fundamentally distinct from those of other self-renewing systems. Live imaging and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that McSCs are mobile, translocating between hair follicle stem cell and transit-amplifying compartments where they reversibly enter distinct differentiation states governed by local microenvironmental cues (for example, WNT). Long-term lineage tracing demonstrated that the McSC system is maintained by reverted McSCs rather than by reserved stem cells inherently exempt from reversible changes. During ageing, there is accumulation of stranded McSCs that do not contribute to the regeneration of melanocyte progeny. These results identify a new model whereby dedifferentiation is integral to homeostatic stem cell maintenance and suggest that modulating McSC mobility may represent a new approach for the prevention of hair greying.","Imaging, Immunofluorescent Staining Method, In Situ Hybridization, Microscopy, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis",Melanoma,Skin,"GSE203051,  GSE113502",Open Access

Here we examine the nature of local immune cell responses during early metastatic seeding in the lung using intracardiac injection to mimic monodispersed metastatic spread. Using syngeneic murine melanoma and colon cancer models, we demonstrate that lung-resident conventional type 2 dendritic cells (DC2) orchestrate a local immune circuit to confer host antimetastatic immunity. Tissue-specific ablation of lung DC2, and not peripheral DC populations, led to increased metastatic burden in the presence of an intact T cell and NK cell compartment.

Here, we used mass-action-based models to describe post-transcriptional regulations, finding that cooperative RNA degradation via multiple microRNA binding sites can generate four-attractor systems without transcriptional feedback.

Given well-known limitations of antibody permeation into solid tumors, our studies clarify benchmarks for CD47 disruption that should be more clinically feasible and safer but just as effective as complete ablation.

Rational design has led to self-assembling peptides with structural similarities to natural materials. However, recreating the dynamic functional properties inherent to natural systems remains challenging. Here we report the discovery of a short peptide based on the tryptophan zipper (trpzip) motif, that shows multiscale hierarchical ordering that leads to emergent dynamic properties. Trpzip hydrogels are antimicrobial and self-healing, with tunable viscoelasticity and unique yield-stress properties that allow immediate harvest of embedded cells through a flick of the wrist. This characteristic makes Trpzip hydrogels amenable to syringe extrusion, which we demonstrate with examples of cell delivery and bioprinting. Trpzip hydrogels display innate bioactivity, allowing propagation of human intestinal organoids with apical-basal polarization. Considering these extensive attributes, we anticipate the Trpzip motif will prove a versatile building block for supramolecular assembly of soft materials for biotechnology and medicine.","Hydrogels, Transmission Electron Microscopy, Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, Cryo-Electron Microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Organoid, Cell Viability Assay, 3D Bioprinting",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,PXD038870,Open Access

Based on the modus operandi established in the early days of chemotherapies, most drugs are administered according to predetermined schedules that seek to deliver the maximum tolerated dose and are only adjusted for toxicity. However, we believe that the complex, evolving nature of cancer requires a more dynamic and personalized approach. Chronicling the milestones of the field, we show that the impact of schedule choice crucially depends on processes driving treatment response and failure. As such, cancer heterogeneity and evolution dictate that a one-size-fits-all solution is unlikely-instead, each patient should be mapped to the strategy that best matches their current disease characteristics and treatment objectives (i.e. their 'tumorscape'). To achieve this level of personalization, we need mathematical modeling. In this perspective, we propose a five-step 'Adaptive Dosing Adjusted for Personalized Tumorscapes (ADAPT)' paradigm to integrate data and understanding across scales and derive dynamic and personalized schedules. We conclude with promising examples of model-guided schedule personalization and a call to action to address key outstanding challenges surrounding data collection, model development, and integration.",Mathematical Modeling,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access

Quantifying fibrillar collagen organization has become a powerful approach for characterizing the topology of collagen fibers and studying the role of collagen fibers in disease progression. We present a deep learning-based pipeline to quantify collagen fibers' topological properties in microscopy-based collagen images from pathological tissue samples. Our method leverages deep neural networks to extract collagen fiber centerlines and deep generative models to create synthetic training data, addressing the current shortage of large-scale annotations. As a part of this effort, we have created and annotated a collagen fiber centerline dataset, with the hope of facilitating further research in this field. Quantitative measurements such as fiber orientation, alignment, density, and length can be derived based on the centerline extraction results. Our pipeline comprises three stages. Initially, a variational autoencoder is trained to generate synthetic centerlines possessing controllable topological properties. Subsequently, a conditional generative adversarial network synthesizes realistic collagen fiber images from the synthetic centerlines, yielding a synthetic training set of image-centerline pairs. Finally, we train a collagen fiber centerline extraction network using both the original and synthetic data. Evaluation using collagen fiber images from pancreas, liver, and breast cancer samples collected via second-harmonic generation microscopy demonstrates our pipeline's superiority over several popular fiber centerline extraction tools. Incorporating synthetic data into training further enhances the network's generalizability.

Here we show that membrane depolarization induces broad metabolic changes, including increased glycolytic activity in DGCs. Increased glucose metabolism in response to stimulation is accompanied by mobilization of endogenous inosine into pentose phosphates via the action of purine nucleotide phosphorylase (PNP).

Myeloid cells within the tumor microenvironment can modulate checkpoint resistance by either supporting or suppressing adaptive immune responses. Using an anti-PD-1-resistant mouse melanoma model, we show that targeting the myeloid compartment via CD40 activation and CSF1R blockade in combination with anti-PD-1 results in complete tumor regression in a majority of mice. This triple therapy combination was primarily CD40 agonist-driven in the first 24 hours after therapy and showed a similar systemic cytokine profile in human patients as was seen in mice. Functional single-cell cytokine secretion profiling of dendritic cells (DC) using a novel microwell assay identified a CCL22+CCL5+ IL12-secreting DC subset as important early-stage effectors of triple therapy. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are both critical effectors of treatment, and systems analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data supported a role for DC-secreted IL12 in priming T-cell activation and recruitment.

The VMT forms de novo within a microfluidic platform by co-culture of multiple human cell types under dynamic, physiological flow conditions. This tissue-engineered micro-tumor construct incorporates a living perfused vascular network that supports the growing tumor mass just as newly formed vessels do in vivo. Importantly, drugs and immune cells must cross the endothelial layer to reach the tumor, modeling in vivo physiological barriers to therapeutic delivery and efficacy. Since the VMT platform is optically transparent, high-resolution imaging of dynamic processes such as immune cell extravasation and metastasis can be achieved with direct visualization of fluorescently labeled cells within the tissue. Further, the VMT retains in vivo tumor heterogeneity, gene expression signatures, and drug responses. Virtually any tumor type can be adapted to the platform, and primary cells from fresh surgical tissues grow and respond to drug treatment in the VMT, paving the way toward truly personalized medicine.

We aimed to evaluate whether outpatient COVID-19 treatment with metformin, ivermectin, or fluvoxamine soon after SARS-CoV-2 infection could reduce the risk of long COVID. Methods: We conducted a decentralised, randomised, quadruple-blind, parallel-group, phase 3 trial (COVID-OUT) at six sites in the USA. We included adults aged 30-85 years with overweight or obesity who had COVID-19 symptoms for fewer than 7 days and a documented SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR or antigen test within 3 days before enrolment. Participants were randomly assigned via 2‚Äà√ó‚Äà3 parallel factorial randomisation (1:1:1:1:1:1) to receive metformin plus ivermectin, metformin plus fluvoxamine, metformin plus placebo, ivermectin plus placebo, fluvoxamine plus placebo, or placebo plus placebo. Participants, investigators, care providers, and outcomes assessors were masked to study group assignment. The primary outcome was severe COVID-19 by day 14, and those data have been published previously. Because the trial was delivered remotely nationwide, the a priori primary sample was a modified intention-to-treat sample, meaning that participants who did not receive any dose of study treatment were excluded. Long COVID diagnosis by a medical provider was a prespecified, long-term secondary outcome. This trial is complete and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04510194. Findings: Between Dec 30, 2020, and Jan 28, 2022, 6602 people were assessed for eligibility and 1431 were enrolled and randomly assigned. Of 1323 participants who received a dose of study treatment and were included in the modified intention-to-treat population, 1126 consented for long-term follow-up and completed at least one survey after the assessment for long COVID at day 180 (564 received metformin and 562 received matched placebo; a subset of participants in the metformin vs placebo trial were also randomly assigned to receive ivermectin or fluvoxamine). 1074 (95%) of 1126 participants completed at least 9 months of follow-up. 632 (56¬∑1%) of 1126 participants were female and 494 (43¬∑9%) were male; 44 (7¬∑0%) of 632 women were pregnant. The median age was 45 years (IQR 37-54) and median BMI was 29¬∑8 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (IQR 27¬∑0-34¬∑2). Overall, 93 (8¬∑3%) of 1126 participants reported receipt of a long COVID diagnosis by day 300. The cumulative incidence of long COVID by day 300 was 6¬∑3% (95% CI 4¬∑2-8¬∑2) in participants who received metformin and 10¬∑4% (7¬∑8-12¬∑9) in those who received identical metformin placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0¬∑59, 95% CI 0¬∑39-0¬∑89; p=0¬∑012). The metformin beneficial effect was consistent across prespecified subgroups. When metformin was started within 3 days of symptom onset, the HR was 0¬∑37 (95% CI 0¬∑15-0¬∑95). There was no effect on cumulative incidence of long COVID with ivermectin (HR 0¬∑99, 95% CI 0¬∑59-1¬∑64) or fluvoxamine (1¬∑36, 0¬∑78-2¬∑34) compared with placebo. Interpretation: Outpatient treatment with metformin reduced long COVID incidence by about 41%, with an absolute reduction of 4¬∑1%, compared with placebo.

Somatic heterozygous missense mutations in the SPOP1 substrate-binding cleft are found in up to 15% of prostate cancers. While mutations in SPOP predict for benefit from androgen receptor signaling inhibition (ARSi) therapy, outcomes for patients with SPOP-mutant (SPOPmut) prostate cancer are heterogeneous and targeted treatments for SPOPmut castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) are lacking. Experimental design: Using in silico genomic and transcriptomic tumor data, proteomics analysis and genetically modified cell line models we demonstrate mechanistic links between SPOP mutations, STING signaling alterations and PARP inhibitor vulnerabilities. Results: We demonstrate that SPOP mutations are associated with upregulation of a 29-gene non-canonical (NC) STING1 (NC-STING) signature in a subset of SPOPmut, treatment-refractory CRPC patients. We show in preclinical CRPC models that SPOP targets and destabilizes STING protein, and prostate cancer Ã∂ associated SPOP mutations result in upregulated NC-STING-NF-Œ∫B signaling and macrophage- and tumor microenvironment (TME)-facilitated reprogramming, leading to tumor cell growth.

Conclusions: We provide evidence that SPOP is critical in regulating immunosuppressive versus anti-tumor activity downstream of DNA damage-induced STING activation in prostate cancer.

These resistant types are largely predetermined by molecular differences between cells before drug addition and not by extrinsic factors. Changes in the dose and type of drug can switch the resistant type of an initial cell, resulting in the generation and elimination of certain resistant types.

The diversity of resistant types as a result of the variability in intrinsic cell states may be a generic feature of responses to external cues.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,"SRX20528874, SRX20528845, SRX20528890, SRX20528793, SRX20528868, SRX20528886, SRX20528799, SRX20528871, SRX20528872, SRX20528877, SRX20528849, SRX20528851, GSE233766, SRX20528792, SRX20545552, SRX20528887, SRX20528813, SRX20545533, SRX20528823, SRX20528841, SRX20528878, SRX20528846, SRX20528830, SRX20545531, SRX20545540, SRX20528790, SRX20528879, SRX20528882, SRX20528798, SRX20528797, SRX20528884, SRX20545542, SRX20528865, SRX20528796, SRX20528806, SRX20528829, SRX20545538, SRX20528827, SRX20528802, SRX20528863, SRX20528810, SRX20545539, SRX20528786, SRX20528856, SRX20528844, SRX20528782, SRX20528817, SRX20528788, SRX20528869, SRX20545546, SRX20528825, SRP440304, SRX20528840, SRX20528857, SRX20545549, SRX20545534, SRX20528794, SRX20528889, SRX20528824, SRX20528894, SRX20528832, SRX20528831, SRX20528848, SRX20528847, SRX20528804, SRX20528787, SRX20528860, SRX20528814, SRX20528780, SRX20528818, SRX20528812, SRX20528866, SRX20528888, SRX20528839, SRX20528885, SRX20545535, SRX20545537, SRX20528864, SRX20528808, SRX20545532, SRX20528880, SRX20545548, SRX20545536, SRX20528785, SRX20528837, SRX20528820, SRX20545547, SRX20528800, SRX20528784, SRX20528870, SRX20528815, SRX20528809, SRX20528826, SRX20528883, SRX20528816, SRX20528811, SRX20528803, SRX20528891, SRP439895, SRX20528836, SRX20545544, SRX20528834, SRX20528822, SRX20528875, SRX20528828, SRX20528801, SRX20528855, SRX20528805, SRX20528850, SRX20528833, SRX20528783, SRX20528795, SRX20528791, SRX20528821, SRX20528819, SRX20528807, SRX20545545, SRX20528881, SRX20528873, SRX20528854, SRX20528789, SRX20528838, GSE233622, SRX20545551, SRX20528861, SRX20528892, SRX20528835, SRX20545543, SRX20528893, SRX20528853, SRX20545550, SRX20528862, SRX20528781, SRX20528859, SRX20528876, SRX20545541, SRX20528842, SRX20528867, SRX20528852, SRX20528858, SRX20528843",Restricted Access
