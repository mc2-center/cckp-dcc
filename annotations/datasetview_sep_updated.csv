Characterising the hierarchy of the various mammary epithelial cells and how they are regulated in response to gestation, lactation and involution is important for understanding how breast cancer develops. Recent studies have used numerous markers to enrich, isolate and characterise the different epithelial cell compartments within the adult mammary gland. However, in all of these studies only a handful of markers were used to define and trace cell populations. Therefore, there is a need for an unbiased and comprehensive description of mammary epithelial cells within the gland at different developmental stages. To this end we used single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to determine the gene expression profile of individual mammary epithelial cells across four adult developmental stages; nulliparous, mid gestation, lactation and post weaning (full natural involution). Our data from 25,010 individual cells identifies 8 distinct mammary epithelial cell populations and allows their hierarchical structure across development to be charted. Interestingly, the effect of gestation and lactation appeared to be more pronounced for some cell types. For example, our analysis revealed a cluster of luminal progenitor cells in post involution glands, which is distinct from progenitors found in nulliparous glands. The data also showed that few clusters could be fully characterized by a single marker gene. We argue instead that the epithelial cells – especially in the luminal compartment – should rather be conceptualized as being part of a continuous spectrum of differentiation. This view highlights the plasticity of the tissue and might help to explain some of the conflicting results from lineage tracing studies.","We compared the gene expression profile at single-cell level of four adult developmental time-points of the murine mammary gland. Tissues were harvested at gestation day 14.5 (G), lactation day 6 (L) and day 11 post natural weaning of the pups (PI). Tissue from NP females was harvested at 8 weeks of age. Two individual mice per developmental time point were used in the study. Lymph node divested mammary glands (excluding the cervical pair) were dissected from the mice and mechanically dissociated. The finely minced tissue was transferred to a digestion mix consisting of DMEM/F12 (Gibco) + 10 mM HEPES (Gibco) + collagenase (Roche) + 200 U ml-1 hyaluronidase (Sigma) + gentamicin (Gibco) and incubated for 3 hours at 37° C.

To elucidate tumoral Treg “connectivity” to diverse tumor-supporting accessory cell types, we explored immediate early changes in their single cell transcriptomes upon punctual Treg depletion in experimental lung cancer and injury-induced inflammation. Prior to any notable T cell activation and inflammation, fibroblasts, endothelial and myeloid cells exhibited pronounced changes in their gene expression in both cancer and injury settings. Factor analysis revealed shared Treg-dependent gene programs, foremost, prominent upregulation of VEGF signaling-related genes upon Treg deprivation in either setting, as well as in Treg-poor vs Treg-rich human lung adenocarcinomas. Accordingly, punctual Treg depletion combined with short-term VEGF blockade showed markedly improved control of PD-1 blockade-resistant lung adenocarcinoma progression in mice compared to the corresponding monotherapies, highlighting a promising factor-based querying approach to elucidating novel rational combination treatments of solid organ cancers.","Three mouse sets of data are deposited.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of how clinically relevant anti-cancer agents modulate cell cycle progression, we used genetically engineered breast cancer cell lines to track drug-induced changes in cell number and cell cycle phase, which revealed drug-specific cell cycle effects that vary across time. We developed a linear chain trick (LCT) computational model, where the cell cycle is partitioned into subphases that can faithfully capture drug-induced dynamic responses. The model correctly infers drug effects and also localizes them to specific cell cycle phases. We used our LCT model to predict the effect of unseen drug combinations and experimentally confirmed the effectiveness of predicted combination treatment strategies. Our integrated experimental and modeling approach opens avenues to assess drug responses, predict effective drug combinations, and identify optimal drug sequencing strategies.","To analyze AU565 image data, phase, GFP, and RFP images were overlaid and collated into single files using FIJI46, then segmented into three classes (nuclei, background, debris) using a manually trained classifier in Ilastik. The segmented nuclear masks from Ilastik and the IncuCyte GFP images were used to count the number of nuclei in each image with Cell Profiler. Additionally, using the same images (nuclear masks from Ilastik and GFP cell cycle reporter images) cell cycle phase was determined by taking the mean fluorescence in the nucleus compared to the mean fluorescence in a 5-pixel ring surrounding the nucleus, excluding background pixels. A threshold was then manually set for the ratio of nuclear fluorescence to cytoplasmic fluorescence and cells with values below the threshold were defined as being in G1 and cells with values above the threshold were defined as being in S/G2 phase48.

To manually track AU565 cells and identify drug-induced changes operable in single cells, GFP image sequences were registered using the FIJI plug-in ‘StackReg’. Individual cells present in the first image and their progeny were followed to identify the time of G1 transition, cell death, and cell division using the plug-in mTrackJ49. We excluded cells that were binucleated, had abnormally large nuclei, or were near the image border where complete lineages could not be tracked. The G1 transition was defined as the last frame before the nuclear intensity of the cell cycle reporter was below the level of the cytoplasm. Assessment of cell death enabled disentangling of cytostatic and cytotoxic drug effects.

We used the following approach for automated analysis of HCC1143, 21MT1 and MDAMB157 cell lines. Image registration was performed on the red channel nuclear marker image stack using the python skimage phase_cross_correlation function to correct translations. Image stacks were cropped to their common areas and individual cells were segmented with the Cellpose LC2 model trained on phase and nuclear images from the untreated and highest drug concentration treatments. Nuclei were segmented with the Cellpose cyto2 model on the nuclear channel. To associate nuclei across the image stack, to identify progeny after mitosis, and to identify cell death events we used Loeffler tracking with the default parameters of delta_t = 3 and roi_size = 2. We created cytoplasm masks by subtracting the nuclear masks from the cell masks and applied these masks to the green channel cell cycle reporter images using the python skimage function regionprops_table. To assign cells to G1 or S/G2 states, we computed the ratios between the cytoplasm and nuclear cell cycle reporter. k-means clustering of the ratios observed in cells in the untreated condition was used to establish a per-plate threshold between cell cycle states.",Human,Mathematical Modeling,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,,,DatasetView,syn32698178

Transcriptome changes are classified into 7 clusters with mainly single-drug clusters. Drug-specific effects on the transcriptome dominate over dose-, time- or toxicity-dependent effects. Two clusters with three TKIs (afatinib, ponatinib and sorafenib) have the top enriched pathway as the endoplasmic reticulum stress.

Here, we use multiplexed imaging, quantitative spatial analysis, and machine learning to create high-definition maps of tumor-bearing lung tissues from the KP (Kras/p53) mouse model and human lung cancer resections. Networks of directly interacting lymphocytes (‘lymphonets’) emerged as a distinctive feature of the anti-cancer immune response. Lymphonets nucleated from small T-cell clusters and incorporated B cells as they increased in size. CXCR3-mediated trafficking modulated lymphonet size and number, but neoantigen expression was required for intratumoral localization. In mouse and human, lymphonets preferentially harbored TCF1+ PD1+ progenitor CD8 T cells that underlie response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Upon treatment of mice with ICB or a neoantigen-targeted vaccine, lymphonets maintained progenitor cells and acquired cytotoxic CD8 T cells, likely seeded from the progenitor population. Spatial mapping further revealed strong segregation of functional CD8 T-cell states and showed physical exclusion of exhausted CD8 T cells from tumor regions.

37444440,GSE223545,CA238728,Functionally and Metabolically Divergent Melanoma-Associated Macrophages Originate from Common Bone-Marrow Precursors,"Melanomas display high numbers of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which correlate with worse prognosis but also retain the potential to restore anti-tumor activity. Harnessing macrophages for therapeutic purposes has been particularly challenging due to their heterogeneity, based on their ontogeny and function and driven by the tissue-specific niche. In the present study, we used the YUMM1.7 murine melanoma model to better understand melanoma TAM origin and dynamics during tumor progression, with potential therapeutic implications. We identified distinct TAM subsets based on F4/80 expression, with the F4/80high fraction increasing over time and displaying tissue-resident-like phenotype. While skin-resident macrophages showed mixed ontogeny, F4/80+ TAM subsets in i.d. YUMM1.7 tumors originated almost exclusively from bone-marrow precursors. Multiparametric analysis of macrophage phenotype showed a temporal divergence of F4/80+ TAM subpopulations, which also differed from skin-resident subsets, and from their monocytic precursors. Overall, F4/80+ TAMs displayed co-expression of M1- and M2-like canonical markers, and RNA-seq and pathway analysis showed differential immunosuppressive and metabolic profiles. GSEA showed F4/80high TAMs to rely on oxidative phosphorylation, with increased proliferation and protein secretion while F4/80low cells had high pro-inflammatory and intracellular signaling pathways, with lipid and polyamine metabolism. Overall, the present in-depth characterization provides further evidence of the ontogeny of the evolving melanoma TAMs. Some of these gene profiles matched recently-identified TAM clusters in other tumor models and human cancers, which in turn can lead to more effective therapies targeting specific immunosuppressive cells in advanced tumor stages.",Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for F4/80+ macrophages (TAMs) sorted from YUMM1.7 murine melanomas.

Here, we used spatial transcriptomics to examine the nature of B cell responses within TLS in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). B cells were enriched in TLS, and therein, we could identify all B cell maturation stages toward plasma cell (PC) formation. B cell repertoire analysis revealed clonal diversification, selection, expansion in TLS, and the presence of fully mature clonotypes at distance. In TLS+ tumors, IgG- and IgA-producing PCs disseminated into the tumor beds along fibroblastic tracks. TLS+ tumors exhibited high frequencies of IgG-producing PCs and IgG-stained and apoptotic malignant cells, suggestive of anti-tumor effector activity. Therapeutic responses and progression-free survival correlated with IgG-stained tumor cells in RCC patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Thus, intratumoral TLS sustains B cell maturation and antibody production that is associated with response to immunotherapy, potentially via direct anti-tumor effects.",Spatial transcriptomics of fresh frozen ccRCC human tumors,Human,"Image Analysis, Computational Tool",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,,,DatasetView,syn35270515

This leads to aberrantly high Notch signaling, but how this translates into deregulated cell cycle control and the transformed cell type is poorly understood. In this report, we analyze downstream responses resulting from the high level of NOTCH 1 signaling in T-ALL. Notch activity, measured immediately downstream of the NOTCH 1 receptor, is high, but expression of the canonical downstream Notch response genes HES 1 and HEY 2 is low both in primary cells from T-ALL patients and in T-ALL cell lines. This suggests that other immediate Notch downstream genes are activated, and we found that Notch signaling controls the levels of expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SKP2 and its target protein p27Kip1. We show that in T-ALL cell lines, recruitment of NOTCH 1 ICD to the SKP2 promoter was accompanied by high SKP2 and low p27Kip1 protein levels were low. In contrast, pharmacologically blocking Notch signaling reversed this picture and led to loss of NOTCH 1 ICD occupancy of the SKP2 promoter, decreased SKP2 and increased p27Kip1 expression. T-ALL cells show a rapid G1-S cell cycle transition, while blocked Notch signaling resulted in G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, also observed by transfection of p27Kip1 or, to a smaller extent, a dominant negative SKP2 allele. Collectively, our data suggest that the aberrantly high Notch signaling in T-ALL maintains SKP2 at a high level and reduces p27Kip1, which leads to more rapid cell cycle progression.",Three independent cultures of the MOLT4 cell line before and 48 hours after addition of the gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT (5 uM).,Human,Computational Tool,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,,,DatasetView,syn43447140

To identify the underlying genetic and transcriptomic landscapes, in this study we analyzed multi-organ metastases and tumor-adjacent tissues from 11 rapid autopsies after treatment with MAPK inhibitor (MAPKi) and/or immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and death due to acquired resistance. Either treatment elicits shared genetic alterations that suggest immune-evasive, cross-therapy resistance mechanisms. Large, non-clustered deletions, inversions and inter-chromosomal translocations dominate rearrangements. Analyzing data from separate melanoma cohorts including 345 therapy-naive patients and 35 patients with patient-matched pre-treatment and post-acquired resistance tumor samples, we performed cross-cohort analyses to identify MAPKi and ICB as respective contributors to gene amplifications and deletions enriched in autopsy versus therapy-naive tumors. In the autopsy cohort, private/late mutations and structural variants display shifted mutational and rearrangement signatures, with MAPKi specifically selecting for signatures of defective homologous-recombination, mismatch and base-excision repair. Transcriptomic signatures and crosstalks with tumor-adjacent macroenvironments nominated organ-specific adaptive pathways. An immune-desert, CD8+-macrophage-biased archetype, T-cell exhaustion and type-2 immunity characterized the immune contexture. This multi-organ analysis of therapy-resistant melanoma presents preliminary insights with potential to improve therapeutic strategies.","This dataset includes WES, WGS, and RNAseq data generated from autopsy samples.",,"Patient Derived Xenograft, RNA Sequencing, Whole Genome Sequencing, Whole Exome Sequencing, Structural Variant Analysis",Cutaneous Melanoma,Skin,,,DatasetView,
