The explicit number of isomers as a function of size is computed using a graph theoretic approach that is compared to a direct count for smaller systems. This allows us to apply a common approach to both nanosystems and their macroscopic limit. The entropy increases very rapidly with size with the results that replacing the actual distribution over size by an average is not an accurate approximation. That the phase transition is a sharp function of the temperature is due to the high heat capacity of both the solid and liquid phases. The difference in entropy at the transition is related to the Trouton-Richards considerations. The finite width of the boundary between two phases of a finite system is related to the inherent uncertainty product that is derived from the maximum entropy formalism and that is a result of the fluctuations about equilibrium. As the system size increases, the boundary becomes sharper and one recovers the usual thermodynamic description.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Restricted Access

Many of these treatments cause cardiotoxicity with limited cure. We aim to clarify molecular mechanisms of TKI-induced cardiotoxicity so as to find potential targets for treating the adverse cardiac complications. Methods: Eight TKIs with different levels of cardiotoxicity reported are selected. Phenotypic and transcriptomic responses of human cardiomyocytes to TKIs at varying doses and times are profiled and analyzed. Stress responses and signaling pathways that modulate cardiotoxicity induced by three TKIs are validated in cardiomyocytes and rat hearts. Results: Toxicity rank of the eight TKIs determined by measuring their effects on cell viability, contractility, and respiration is largely consistent with that derived from database or literature, indicating that human cardiomyocytes are a good cellular model for studying cardiotoxicity. When transcriptomes are measured for selected TKI treatments with different levels of toxicity in human cardiomyocytes, the data are classified into 7 clusters with mainly single-drug clusters. Drug-specific effects on the transcriptome dominate over dose-, time- or toxicity-dependent effects. Two clusters with three TKIs (afatinib, ponatinib, and sorafenib) have the top enriched pathway as the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). All three TKIs induce ERS in rat primary cardiomyocytes and ponatinib activates the IRE1α-XBP1s axis downstream of ERS in the hearts of rats underwent a 7-day course of drug treatment. To look for potential triggers of ERS, we find that the three TKIs induce transient reactive oxygen species followed by lipid peroxidation. Inhibiting either PERK or IRE1α downstream of ERS blocks TKI-induced cardiac damages, represented by the induction of cardiac fetal and pro-inflammatory genes without causing more cell death. Conclusions: Our data contain rich information about phenotypic and transcriptional responses of human cardiomyocytes to eight TKIs, uncovering potential molecular mechanisms in modulating cardiotoxicity. ER stress is activated by multiple TKIs and leads to cardiotoxicity through promoting expression of pro-inflammatory factors and cardiac fetal genes. ER stress-induced inflammation is a promising therapeutic target to mitigate ponatinib- and sorafenib-induced cardiotoxicity.",Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-derived Cardiomyocytes Culture,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,GSE221595,Open Access

In particular, complex biophysical mechanisms enable a tumor to remodel the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), allowing cells to invade alone or collectively. Tumor spheroids cultured in collagen represent a simplified, reproducible 3D model system, which is sufficiently complex to recapitulate the evolving organization of cells and interaction with the ECM that occur during invasion. Recent experimental approaches enable high resolution imaging and quantification of the internal structure of invading tumor spheroids. Concurrently, computational modeling enables simulations of complex multicellular aggregates based on first principles. The comparison between real and simulated spheroids represents a way to fully exploit both data sources, but remains a challenge. We hypothesize that comparing any two spheroids requires first the extraction of basic features from the raw data, and second the definition of key metrics to match such features. Here, we present a novel method to compare spatial features of spheroids in 3D. To do so, we define and extract features from spheroid point cloud data, which we simulated using Cells in Silico (CiS), a high-performance framework for large-scale tissue modeling previously developed by us. We then define metrics to compare features between individual spheroids, and combine all metrics into an overall deviation score. Finally, we use our features to compare experimental data on invading spheroids in increasing collagen densities. We propose that our approach represents the basis for defining improved metrics to compare large 3D data sets. Moving forward, this approach will enable the detailed analysis of spheroids of any origin, one application of which is informing in silico spheroids based on their in vitro counterparts. This will enable both basic and applied researchers to close the loop between modeling and experiments in cancer research.",Computational Modeling,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access

Ligand promiscuity among these receptors makes them an interesting target to explore multiple aspects of biased agonism. Here, we comprehensively characterize two chemokine receptors namely, CXCR4 and CXCR7, in terms of their transducer-coupling and downstream signaling upon their stimulation by a common chemokine agonist, CXCL12, and a small molecule agonist, VUF11207. We observe that CXCR7 lacks G-protein-coupling while maintaining robust βarr recruitment with a major contribution of GRK5/6. On the other hand, CXCR4 displays robust G-protein activation as expected but exhibits significantly reduced βarr-coupling compared to CXCR7. These two receptors induce distinct βarr conformations even when activated by the same agonist, and CXCR7, unlike CXCR4, fails to activate ERK1/2 MAP kinase. We also identify a key contribution of a single phosphorylation site in CXCR7 for βarr recruitment and endosomal localization. Our study provides molecular insights into intrinsic-bias encoded in the CXCR4-CXCR7 system with broad implications for drug discovery.","Cell Culture, Chemotaxis Assay

Small RNA sequencing (small RNA-seq) has been widely used to characterize the small RNA content in EVs. However, there is a lack of a systematic assessment of the quality, technical biases, RNA composition, and RNA biotypes enrichment for small RNA profiling of EVs across cell types, biofluids, and conditions. Methods: We collected and reanalyzed small RNA-seq datasets for 2756 samples from 83 studies involving 55 with EVs only and 28 with both EVs and matched donor cells. We assessed their quality by the total number of reads after adapter trimming, the overall alignment rate to the host and non-host genomes, and the proportional abundance of total small RNA and specific biotypes, such as miRNA, tRNA, rRNA, and Y RNA. Results: We found that EV extraction methods varied in their reproducibility in isolating small RNAs, with effects on small RNA composition. Comparing proportional abundances of RNA biotypes between EVs and matched donor cells, we discovered that rRNA and tRNA fragments were relatively enriched, but miRNAs and snoRNA were depleted in EVs. Except for the export of eight miRNAs being context-independent, the selective release of most miRNAs into EVs was study-specific.

Prior studies have shown that cells in the buccal mucosa carry a molecular signature of lung cancer among the cigarette-smoking population, the phenomenon known as field carcinogenesis or field of injury. Thus, we hypothesized that chromatin structural changes in buccal mucosa can be predictive of lung cancer. However, the small size of the chromatin chain (approximately 20 nm) folded into chromatin packing domains, themselves typically below 300 nm in diameter, preclude the detection of alterations in intradomain chromatin conformation using diffraction-limited optical microscopy.

Here, we study interactions between estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell lineages that are sensitive and resistant to ribociclib-induced cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibition. In mono- and coculture, we find that sensitive cells grow and compete more effectively in the absence of treatment. During treatment with ribociclib, sensitive cells survive and proliferate better when grown together with resistant cells than when grown in monoculture, termed facilitation in ecology. Molecular, protein, and genomic analyses show that resistant cells increase metabolism and production of estradiol, a highly active estrogen metabolite, and increase estrogen signaling in sensitive cells to promote facilitation in coculture. Adding estradiol in monoculture provides sensitive cells with increased resistance to therapy and cancels facilitation in coculture. Under partial inhibition of estrogen signaling through low-dose endocrine therapy, estradiol supplied by resistant cells facilitates sensitive cell growth. However, a more complete blockade of estrogen signaling, through higher-dose endocrine therapy, diminished the facilitative growth of sensitive cells. Mathematical modeling quantifies the strength of competition and facilitation during CDK4/6 inhibition and predicts that blocking facilitation has the potential to control both resistant and sensitive cancer cell populations and inhibit the emergence of a refractory population during cell cycle therapy.","3D Cell Culture, Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry, Western Blotting, RNA Sequencing, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing, Mathematical Modeling",Breast Adenocarcinoma,Breast,"GSE143944, GSE193278",Open Access

Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) triggers apoptosis in multiple tumor types, while evading healthy cells, through a transcription-independent mechanism. GBM is particularly resistant to TRAIL, but studies have found that the mechanoreceptor Piezo1 can be activated under static conditions via Yoda1 agonist to induce TRAIL sensitization in other cancer cell lines. This study examines the effects and the mechanism of chemical and mechanical activation of Piezo1, via Yoda1 and fluid shear stress (FSS) stimulation, on TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in GBM cells. Here, we demonstrate that Yoda1 + TRAIL and FSS + TRAIL combination therapies significantly increase apoptosis in two GBM cell lines relative to controls. Further, cells known to be resistant to TMZ were found to have higher levels of Piezo1 expression and were more susceptible to TRAIL sensitization by Piezo1 activation. The combinatory Yoda1 + TRAIL treatment significantly decreased cell viability in TMZ-resistant GBM cells when compared to treatment with both low and high doses of TMZ.

These vascular effects cause significant morbidity and may contribute to mortality from the disease. Given that abnormal vasculature and poor oxygenation are also hallmarks of solid tumors, lessons from the treatment of cancer may help identify drugs that can be repurposed to treat COVID-19.

Therefore, these therapies, which have been extensively explored in clinical trials of patients with cancer, may have beneficial effects on the vasculature of patients with COVID-19.

Experimental design: We performed targeted error-correction sequencing on 171 serial plasmas and matched white blood cell (WBC) DNA from 33 patients with metastatic SCLC who received treatment with chemotherapy (n = 16) or immunotherapy-containing (n = 17) regimens. Tumor-derived sequence alterations and plasma aneuploidy were evaluated serially and combined to assess changes in total cell-free tumor load (cfTL). Longitudinal dynamic changes in cfTL were monitored to determine circulating cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) molecular response during therapy. Results: Combined tiered analyses of tumor-derived sequence alterations and plasma aneuploidy allowed for the assessment of ctDNA molecular response in all patients. Patients classified as molecular responders (n = 9) displayed sustained elimination of cfTL to undetectable levels. For 14 patients, we observed initial molecular responses, followed by ctDNA recrudescence. A subset of patients (n = 10) displayed a clear pattern of molecular progression, with persistence of cfTL across all time points. Molecular responses captured the therapeutic effect and long-term clinical outcomes in a more accurate and rapid manner compared with radiographic imaging. Patients with sustained molecular responses had longer overall (log-rank P = 0.0006) and progression-free (log-rank P < 0.0001) survival, with molecular responses detected on average 4 weeks earlier than imaging. Conclusions: ctDNA analyses provide a precise approach for the assessment of early on-therapy molecular responses and have important implications for the management of patients with SCLC, including the development of improved strategies for real-time tumor burden monitoring.

In this prospective multicenter sample collection study, MTV was retrospectively calculated via commercial software at baseline, 1, and 3 months after chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy; ctDNA was available before and after axi-cel administration.

However, optimal dosing schedules depend on the properties of metastases, which are often not directly measurable in clinical practice. Here, we proposed a framework for estimating features of metastases through tumor response dynamics during the first adaptive therapy treatment cycle. Longitudinal prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in 16 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer undergoing adaptive androgen deprivation treatment were analyzed to investigate relationships between cycle dynamics and clinical variables such as Gleason score, the change in the number of metastases over a cycle, and the total number of cycles over the course of treatment. The first cycle of adaptive therapy, which consists of a response period (applying therapy until 50% PSA reduction), and a regrowth period (removing treatment until reaching initial PSA levels), delineated several features of the computational metastatic system: larger metastases had longer cycles; a higher proportion of drug-resistant cells slowed the cycles; and a faster cell turnover rate sped up drug response time and slowed regrowth time. The number of metastases did not affect cycle times, as response dynamics were dominated by the largest tumors rather than the aggregate. In addition, systems with higher intermetastasis heterogeneity responded better to continuous therapy and correlated with dynamics from patients with high or low Gleason scores. Conversely, systems with higher intrametastasis heterogeneity responded better to adaptive therapy and correlated with dynamics from patients with intermediate Gleason scores.

Methods: We developed an IDH wild-type (IDHwt) GBM-specific single immune cell reference consisting of B cells, T-cells, NK-cells, microglia, tumor associated macrophages, monocytes, mast and DC cells. We used this alongside an existing neoplastic single cell-type reference for astrocyte-like, oligodendrocyte- and neuronal progenitor-like and mesenchymal GBM cancer cells to create both marker and gene signature matrix-based deconvolution tools. We applied single-cell resolution imaging mass cytometry (IMC) to ten IDHwt GBM samples, five paired primary and recurrent tumors, to determine which deconvolution approach performed best.

Elacestrant, a new generation FDA-approved oral selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) and antagonist, has demonstrated efficacy in a subset of women with advanced HR+breast cancer, but there are few patient-derived models to characterize its effect in advanced cancers with diverse treatment histories and acquired mutations. Methods: We analyzed clinical outcomes with elacestrant, compared with endocrine therapy, among women who had previously been treated with a fulvestrant-containing regimen from the recent phase 3 EMERALD Study. We further modeled sensitivity to elacestrant, compared with the currently approved SERD, fulvestrant in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and cultured circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Results: Analysis of the subset of breast cancer patients enrolled in the EMERALD study who had previously received a fulvestrant-containing regimen indicates that they had better progression-free survival with elacestrant than with standard-of-care endocrine therapy, a finding that was independent estrogen receptor (ESR1) gene mutations. We modeled elacestrant responsiveness using patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and in ex vivo cultured CTCs derived from patients with HR+breast cancer extensively treated with multiple endocrine therapies, including fulvestrant. Both CTCs and PDX models are refractory to fulvestrant but sensitive to elacestrant, independent of mutations in ESR1 and Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-Bisphosphate 3-Kinase Catalytic Subunit Alpha (PIK3CA) genes. Conclusion: Elacestrant retains efficacy in breast cancer cells that have acquired resistance to currently available ER targeting therapies. Elacestrant may be an option for patients with HR+/HER2- breast cancer whose disease progressed on fulvestrant in the metastatic setting. Translational relevance: Serial endocrine therapy is the mainstay of management for metastatic HR+breast cancer, but acquisition of drug resistance highlights the need for better therapies. Elacestrant is a recently FDA-approved novel oral selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD), with demonstrated efficacy in the EMERALD phase 3 clinical trial of refractory HR+breast cancer. Subgroup analysis of the EMERALD clinical trial identifies clinical benefit with elacestrant in patients who had received prior fulvestrant independent of the mutational status of the ESR1 gene, supporting its potential utility in treating refractory HR+breast cancer. Here, we use pre-clinical models, including ex vivo cultures of circulating tumor cells and patient-derived xenografts, to demonstrate the efficacy of elacestrant in breast cancer cells with acquired resistance to fulvestrant.","Clinical Study, Patient Derived Xenograft, Immunohistochemistry Staining Method, qPCR","Breast Adenocarcinoma, Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma",Breast,Not Applicable,Open Access

Although recent large-scale transcriptomic studies have demonstrated that heterogeneous gene expressions play an essential role in determining molecular phenotypes of PDA, biological cues for and consequences of distinct transcriptional programs remain unclear. Methods: We developed an experimental model that enforces the transition of PDA cells toward a basal-like subtype. We combined epigenome and transcriptome analyses with extensive in vitro and in vivo evaluations of tumorigenicity to demonstrate the validity of basal-like subtype differentiation in association with endothelial-like enhancer landscapes via TEA domain transcription factor 2 (TEAD2). Finally, we used loss-of-function experiments to investigate the importance of TEAD2 in regulating reprogrammed enhancer landscape and metastasis in basal-like PDA cells. Results: Aggressive characteristics of the basal-like subtype are faithfully recapitulated in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating the physiological relevance of our model. Further, we showed that basal-like subtype PDA cells acquire a TEAD2-dependent proangiogenic enhancer landscape. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibitions of TEAD2 in basal-like subtype PDA cells impair their proangiogenic phenotypes in vitro and cancer progression in vivo. Last, we identify CD109 as a critical TEAD2 downstream mediator that maintains constitutively activated JAK-STAT signaling in basal-like PDA cells and tumors. Conclusions: Our findings implicate a TEAD2-CD109-JAK/STAT axis in the basal-like differentiated pancreatic cancer cells and as a potential therapeutic vulnerability.","Cell Culture, Plasmid Construction, RT-PCR, ChIP-Seq, ATAC-Seq, RNA Sequencing",Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma,Pancreas,GSE202534,Open Access

Moreover, high NOS2-expressing tumor cells were proximal to areas with increased satellitosis, suggestive of cell clusters with a higher metastatic potential. Further in vitro experiments revealed that IFNγ + IL1β/TNFα increased the elongation and migration of treated tumor cells. This spatial analysis of the tumor microenvironment provides important insight into distinct neighborhoods where stroma-restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells exist proximal to NOS2-expressing tumor niches that could have increased metastatic potential.","Cell Culture, Scratch Assay, Invasion Assay, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing, Immunohistochemistry Staining Method","Breast Adenocarcinoma, Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma",Breast,Not Applicable,Open Access

Understanding what is consistent and varies across species can provide new insights into cancer initiation and evolution, with significant implications for animal welfare and wildlife conservation. We build a pan-species cancer digital pathology atlas (panspecies.ai) and conduct a pan-species study of computational comparative pathology using a supervised convolutional neural network algorithm trained on human samples. The artificial intelligence algorithm achieves high accuracy in measuring immune response through single-cell classification for two transmissible cancers (canine transmissible venereal tumour, 0.94; Tasmanian devil facial tumour disease, 0.88). In 18 other vertebrate species (mammalia = 11, reptilia = 4, aves = 2, and amphibia = 1), accuracy (range 0.57-0.94) is influenced by cell morphological similarity preserved across different taxonomic groups, tumour sites, and variations in the immune compartment. Furthermore, a spatial immune score based on artificial intelligence and spatial statistics is associated with prognosis in canine melanoma and prostate tumours. A metric, named morphospace overlap, is developed to guide veterinary pathologists towards rational deployment of this technology on new samples. This study provides the foundation and guidelines for transferring artificial intelligence technologies to veterinary pathology based on understanding of morphological conservation, which could vastly accelerate developments in veterinary medicine and comparative oncology.",Computational Modeling,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access

We performed whole transcriptome (n = 46), whole exome (n = 40), and gene copy number (n = 43) sequencing on G3 NEN formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples from diverse organs (in total, 17 were lung, 16 were gastroenteropancreatic, and 13 other). G3 NENs despite arising from diverse primary sites did not have gene expression profiles that were easily segregated by organ of origin. Across all G3 NENs, TP53, APC, RB1, and CDKN2A were significantly mutated. The CDK4/6 cell cycling pathway was mutated in 95% of cases, with upregulation of oncogenes within this pathway. G3 NENs had high tumor mutation burden (mean 7.09 mutations/MB), with 20% having >10 mutations/MB. Two somatic copy number alterations were significantly associated with worse prognosis across tissue types: focal deletion 22q13.31 (HR, 7.82; P = 0.034) and arm amplification 19q (HR, 4.82; P = 0.032).

Aim: We aim to design, validate, and demonstrate a proof-of-concept light-sheet system for NAD(P)H FLIM. Approach: A single-photon avalanche diode camera was integrated into a light-sheet microscope to achieve optical sectioning and limit out-of-focus contributions for NAD(P)H FLIM of single cells.

Methods: MDNA55-05 is an open-label, single-arm phase IIb study of MDNA55 in recurrent GBM (rGBM) patients with an aggressive form of GBM (de novo GBM, IDH wild-type, and nonresectable at recurrence) on their 1st or 2nd recurrence. MDNA55 was administered intratumorally as a single dose treatment (dose range of 18 to 240 ug) using convection-enhanced delivery (CED) with up to 4 stereo-tactically placed catheters. It was co-infused with a contrast agent (Gd-DTPA, Magnevist®) to assess distribution in and around the tumor margins. The flow rate of each catheter did not exceed 10μL/min to ensure that the infusion duration did not exceed 48 h. The primary endpoint was mOS, with secondary endpoints determining the effects of IL4R status on mOS and PFS. Results: MDNA55 showed an acceptable safety profile at doses up to 240 μg. In all evaluable patients (n = 44) mOS was 11.64 months (80% one-sided CI 8.62, 15.02) and OS-12 was 46%.

Circulating hybrid cells (CHCs), which have both immune and tumor cell phenotypes, are detectable in the peripheral blood of patients with gastrointestinal cancers, but their potential as an indicator of treatment response is unexplored. Methods: Peripheral blood specimens were collected from RAC and EAC patients after neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) or longitudinally during therapy and evaluated for CHC levels by immunostaining. Receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) and the Kaplan-Meier method were used to analyze the CHC level as a predictor of pathologic response to NAT and disease-specific survival (DSS), respectively. Results: Patients with RAC (n = 23) and EAC (n = 34) were sampled on the day of resection, and 11 patients (32%) demonstrated a pathologic complete response (pCR) to NAT. On ROC analysis, CHC levels successfully discriminated pCR from non-pCR with an area under the curve of 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.92; P < 0.001). Additionally, CHC levels in the EAC patients correlated with residual nodal involvement (P = 0.026) and 1-year DSS (P = 0.029). The patients with RAC who were followed longitudinally during NAT (n = 2) and hepatic arterial infusion therapy for CRLM (n = 2) had CHC levels that decreased with therapy response and increased before clinical evidence of disease progression. Conclusion: Circulating hybrid cells are a novel blood-based biomarker with potential for monitoring treatment response and disease progression to help guide decisions for further systemic therapy, definitive resection, and post-therapy surveillance.

CSN5, a putative androgen receptor (AR) partner that is located on chromosome 8q, is the key subunit of the COP9 signalosome, which deactivates ubiquitin ligases. Deregulation of CSN5 could affect diverse cellular functions that contribute to tumor development, but there has been no comprehensive study of its function in prostate cancer. The clinical significance of CSN5 amplification/overexpression was evaluated in 16 prostate cancer clinical cohorts. Its oncogenic activity was assessed by genetic and pharmacologic perturbations of CSN5 activity in prostate cancer cell lines. The molecular mechanisms of CSN5 function were assessed, as was the efficacy of the CSN5 inhibitor CSN5i-3 in vitro and in vivo. Finally, the transcription cofactor activity of CSN5 in prostate cancer cells was determined. The prognostic significance of CSN5 amplification and overexpression in prostate cancer was independent of MYC amplification. Inhibition of CSN5 inhibited its oncogenic function by targeting AR signaling, DNA repair, multiple oncogenic pathways, and spliceosome regulation. Furthermore, inhibition of CSN5 repressed metabolic pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis in AR-negative prostate cancer cells. Targeting CSN5 with CSN5i-3 showed potent antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, CSN5i-3 synergizes with PARP inhibitors to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth. CSN5 functions as a transcription cofactor to cooperate with multiple transcription factors in prostate cancer. Inhibiting CSN5 strongly attenuates prostate cancer progression and could enhance PARP inhibition efficacy in the treatment of prostate cancer.","Cell Culture, CUT&Tag-Sequencing, RNA Sequencing, Xenograft",Prostate Adenocarcinoma,Prostate Gland,"GSE173469, GSE173466, GSE173467",Open Access

We generated a genetically engineered mouse with prostate-specific expression of the <i>ETS</i> factor, ETV4, at lower and higher protein dosage through mutation of its degron. Lower-level expression of ETV4 caused mild luminal cell expansion without histologic abnormalities, and higher-level expression of stabilized ETV4 caused prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN) with 100% penetrance within 1 week.

Tracking metastatic spread in living patients is difficult and thus poorly understood. Methods: Via rapid autopsy, we have collected 30 tumor samples over 3 timepoints and across 8 organs from a triple-negative metastatic breast cancer patient. The large number of sites sampled, together with deep whole-genome sequencing and advanced computational analysis, allowed us to comprehensively reconstruct the tumor's evolution at subclonal resolution. Results: The most unique, previously unreported aspect of the tumor's evolution that we observed in this patient was the presence of ""subclone incubators,"" defined as metastatic sites where substantial tumor evolution occurs before colonization of additional sites and organs by subclones that initially evolved at the incubator site. Overall, we identified four discrete waves of metastatic expansions, each of which resulted in a number of new, genetically similar metastasis sites that also enriched for particular organs (e.g., abdominal vs bone and brain). The lung played a critical role in facilitating metastatic spread in this patient: the lung was the first site of metastatic escape from the primary breast lesion, subclones at this site were likely the source of all four subsequent metastatic waves, and multiple sites in the lung acted as subclone incubators. Finally, functional annotation revealed that many known drivers or metastasis-promoting tumor mutations in this patient were shared by some, but not all metastatic sites, highlighting the need for more comprehensive surveys of a patient's metastases for effective clinical intervention. Conclusions: Our analysis revealed the presence of substantial tumor evolution at metastatic incubator sites in a patient, with potentially important clinical implications.

Here, we integrated transcriptomic data and digital pathology images to study the prognostic implications, spatial locations, and constitution of immune rich areas (immune hotspots) in a cohort of 935 patients with lung cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas. A high intratumoral immune hotspot score, which measures the proportion of immune hotspots interfacing with tumor islands, was correlated with poor overall survival in lung squamous cell carcinoma but not in lung adenocarcinoma. Lung squamous cell carcinomas with high intratumoral immune hotspot scores were characterized by consistent upregulation of B-cell signatures. Spatial statistical analyses conducted on serial multiplex IHC slides further revealed that only 4.87% of peritumoral immune hotspots and 0.26% of intratumoral immune hotspots were tertiary lymphoid structures. Significantly lower densities of CD20+CXCR5+ and CD79b+ B cells and less diverse immune cell interactions were found in intratumoral immune hotspots compared with peritumoral immune hotspots. Furthermore, there was a negative correlation between the percentages of CD8+ T cells and T regulatory cells in intratumoral but not in peritumoral immune hotspots, with tertiary lymphoid structures excluded. These findings suggest that the intratumoral immune hotspots reflect an immunosuppressive niche compared with peritumoral immune hotspots, independent of the distribution of tertiary lymphoid structures.

Oblique plane microscopy (OPM) provides high spatiotemporal resolution, but the field of view is typically limited by its optical train and the pixel number of the camera. Mechanically scanning the sample or decreasing the overall magnification of the imaging system can partially address this challenge, albeit by reducing the volumetric imaging speed or spatial resolution, respectively. Here, we introduce a novel dual-axis scan unit for OPM that facilitates rapid and high-resolution volumetric imaging throughout a volume of 800 × 500 × 200 microns. This enables us to perform volumetric imaging of cell monolayers, spheroids and zebrafish embryos with subcellular resolution. Furthermore, we combined this microscope with a multi-perspective projection imaging technique that increases the volumetric interrogation rate to more than 10 Hz. This allows us to rapidly probe a large field of view in a dimensionality reduced format, identify features of interest, and volumetrically image these regions with high spatiotemporal resolution.",Microscopy,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access

Its microenvironment is modified to provide a niche that is conducive for colorectal cancer cell growth. This study focused on characterizing the cellular changes in the metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) liver tumor microenvironment (TME). Experimental design: We analyzed a series of microsatellite stable (MSS) mCRCs to the liver, paired normal liver tissue, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We validated our findings using multiplexed spatial imaging and bulk gene expression with cell deconvolution. Results: We identified TME-specific SPP1-expressing macrophages with altered metabolism features, foam cell characteristics, and increased activity in extracellular matrix (ECM) organization. SPP1+ macrophages and fibroblasts expressed complementary ligand-receptor pairs with the potential to mutually influence their gene-expression programs. TME lacked dysfunctional CD8 T cells and contained regulatory T cells, indicative of immunosuppression. Spatial imaging validated these cell states in the TME. Moreover, TME macrophages and fibroblasts had close spatial proximity, which is a requirement for intercellular communication and networking. In an independent cohort of mCRCs in the liver, we confirmed the presence of SPP1+ macrophages and fibroblasts using gene-expression data. An increased proportion of TME fibroblasts was associated with the worst prognosis in these patients. Conclusions: We demonstrated that mCRC in the liver is characterized by transcriptional alterations of macrophages in the TME. Intercellular networking between macrophages and fibroblasts supports colorectal cancer growth in the immunosuppressed metastatic niche in the liver. These features can be used to target immune-checkpoint-resistant MSS tumors.","Single Cell RNA-Sequencing, RNA Sequencing

However, using these models to perform a multitude of experiments, including drug screening, is prohibitive both in terms of cost and time. Three-dimensional (3D) culture systems are widely viewed as platforms in which cancer cells retain their biological integrity through biochemical interactions, morphology, and architecture. Our team has extensive experience culturing PDX cells in vitro using 3D matrices composed of hyaluronic acid (HA). In order to separate mouse fibroblast stromal cells associated with PDXs, we use rotation culture, where stromal cells adhere to the surface of tissue culture-treated plates while dissociated PDX tumor cells float and self-associate into multicellular clusters. Also floating in the supernatant are single, often dead cells, which present a challenge in collecting viable PDX clusters for downstream encapsulation into hydrogels for 3D cell culture. In order to separate these single cells from live cell clusters, we have employed density step gradient centrifugation. The protocol described here allows for the depletion of non-viable single cells from the healthy population of cell clusters that will be used for further in vitro experimentation. In our studies, we incorporate the 3D cultures in microfluidic plates which allow for media perfusion during culture. After assessing the resultant cultures using a fluorescent image-based viability assay of purified versus non-purified cells, our results show that this additional separation step substantially reduced the number of non-viable cells from our cultures.","Patient Derived Xenograft, Hydrogels, Microfluidics",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access

In RSL3-resistant, but not sensitive, luminal breast cancer cell lines, RSL3 induces HER2 pathway activation. Irreversible HER2 inhibitors including neratinib reversed RSL3 resistance in constitutively RSL3-resistant cell lines.

Either treatment elicits shared genetic alterations that suggest immune-evasive, cross-therapy resistance mechanisms. Large, non-clustered deletions, inversions and inter-chromosomal translocations dominate rearrangements. Analyzing data from separate melanoma cohorts including 345 therapy-naive patients and 35 patients with patient-matched pre-treatment and post-acquired resistance tumor samples, we performed cross-cohort analyses to identify MAPKi and ICB as respective contributors to gene amplifications and deletions enriched in autopsy versus therapy-naive tumors. In the autopsy cohort, private/late mutations and structural variants display shifted mutational and rearrangement signatures, with MAPKi specifically selecting for signatures of defective homologous-recombination, mismatch and base-excision repair.

We predict that early life adversity can shift investment in somatic maintenance and accelerate the timing of reproduction, which may mediate or interact with the risk of breast cancer. Methodology: We use population-wide data from the Utah Population Database (UPDB) and Utah Cancer Registry, leading to 24 957 cases of women diagnosed with breast cancer spanning 20 years (1990-2010) and 124 785 age-matched controls. We generated a cumulative early life adversity summation score to evaluate the interaction (moderation) and mediation between early life adversity, reproductive history and their association with breast cancer risk. Results: Our analyses led to three key findings: (i) more early life adversity, when considered as a main effect, accelerates the time to first birth and death, (ii) early age at first birth and high parity decreases the risk of breast cancer and (iii) we find no association between early adversity and breast cancer risk either as a main effect or in its interaction with reproductive history. Conclusion and implications: Early adversity elevates the risk of overall mortality through mechanisms other than breast cancer risk. This suggests early life factors can generate different effects on health.

Indeed, hot spot-activating mutations in GNAQ/GNA11, encoding Gαq proteins, are known to be driver oncogenes in uveal melanoma (UM), for which there are limited effective therapies currently available. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) has been recently shown to be a central mediator of Gαq-driven signaling in UM, and as a result, is being explored clinically as a therapeutic target for UM, both alone and in combination therapies. Despite this, the repertoire of Gαq/FAK-regulated signaling mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Here, we used a whole-genome CRISPR screen in GNAQ-mutant UM cells to identify mechanisms that, when overactivated, lead to reduced sensitivity to FAK inhibition. In this way, we found that the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway represented a major resistance driver. Our dissection of the underlying mechanisms revealed that Gαq promotes PI3K/AKT activation via a conserved signaling circuitry mediated by FAK. Further analysis demonstrated that FAK activates PI3K through the association and tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K and that UM cells require PI3K/AKT signaling for survival.

Because of substantial interobserver variability in the application of the BI-RADS lexicon, the decision to biopsy varies greatly and results in overdiagnosis and excessive biopsies. The false-positive rate from mammograms is estimated to be 7% to approximately 10% overall, but within the BI-RADS 4 category, it is greater than 70%. Therefore, we developed the Breast Cancer Risk Calculator (BRISK) to target a well-characterized and specific patient subgroup (BI-RADS 4) rather than a broad heterogeneous group in assessing breast cancer risk. Methods: BRISK provides a novel precise risk assessment model to reduce overdiagnosis and unnecessary biopsies. It was developed by applying natural language processing and deep learning methods on 5,147 patient records archived in the Houston Methodist systemwide data warehouse from 2006 to May 2015, including imaging and pathology reports, mammographic images, and patient demographics. Key characteristics for BI-RADS 4 patients were collected and computed to output an index measure for biopsy recommendation that is clinically relevant and informative and improves upon the traditional BI-RADS 4 scores. Results: For the validation set, we assessed data from 1,247 BI-RADS 4 patients, including mammographic images and medical reports. The BRISK model sensitivity to predict malignancy was 100%, whereas the specificity was 74%. The total accuracy of our implemented model in BRISK was 81%. Overall area under the curve was 0.93. Conclusion: BRISK for abnormal mammogram uses integrative artificial intelligence technology and has demonstrated high sensitivity in the prediction of malignancy.

Simulations reveal that active cell tension can stabilize cadherin bonds, but excessive RhoA signaling can drive bond dissociation and junction failure. While actin polymerization aids gap closure, high levels of Rac1 can induce junction weakening. Combining the modeling framework with experiments, our model predicts the influence of pharmacological treatments on the junction state and identifies that a critical balance between RhoA and Rac1 expression is required to maintain junction stability.

This suggests that there may be an important biological relationship between chimerism and susceptibility to tissue invasion by cancerous cells. Studying chimerism might help us identify mechanisms underlying invasive cancers and also could provide insights into the detection and management of emerging transmissible cancers.","Phylogenetic Analysis, Data Integration",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access

Methods: To characterize the role of CXCR2 during melanoma tumorigenesis, we generated tamoxifen-inducible tyrosinase-promoter driven Braf<sup>V600E</sup>/Pten<sup>-/-</sup>/Cxcr2<sup>-/-</sup> and NRas<sup>Q61R</sup>/INK4a<sup>-/-</sup>/Cxcr2<sup>-/-</sup> melanoma models.

Potential mechanisms by which Cxcr2 affects melanoma tumorigenesis in these murine models were explored using RNAseq, mMCP-counter, ChIPseq, and qRT-PCR; flow cytometry, and reverse phosphoprotein analysis (RPPA). Results: Genetic loss of Cxcr2 or pharmacological inhibition of CXCR1/CXCR2 during melanoma tumor induction resulted in key changes in gene expression that reduced tumor incidence/growth and increased anti-tumor immunity. Interestingly, after Cxcr2 ablation, Tfcp2l1, a key tumor suppressive transcription factor, was the only gene significantly induced with a log<sub>2</sub> fold-change greater than 2 in these three different melanoma models. Conclusions: Here, we provide novel mechanistic insight revealing how loss of Cxcr2 expression/activity in melanoma tumor progenitor cells results in reduced tumor burden and creation of an anti-tumor immune microenvironment. This mechanism entails an increase in expression of the tumor suppressive transcription factor, Tfcp2l1, along with alteration in the expression of genes involved in growth regulation, tumor suppression, stemness, differentiation, and immune modulation. These gene expression changes are coincident with reduction in the activation of key growth regulatory pathways, including AKT and mTOR.","Cell Culture, RNA Sequencing, ChIP-Seq, RT-qPCR, Flow Cytometry",Cutaneous Melanoma,Skin,GSE223285,Open Access

Here, we sought to better understand the mechanism through which MIM-B promotes tumor metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: We performed confocal microscopy analysis to determine the distributions of MIM-B and caveolin-1 and conducted co-immunoprecipitation assays to detect the interactions between MIM-B and caveolin-1 <i>in vitro</i>. We performed transwell assays to analyze the invasive ability of HCC cells. Changes in the expression levels of key genes and some molecular makers were detected by immunohistochemistry and western blotting in HCC tissue samples. Results: We found that MIM-B co-localizes with caveolin-1 and demonstrated that MIM-B and caveolin-1 interact <i>in vitro</i>. Repressing MIM-B and caveolin-1 expression inhibited the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway. We overexpressed MIM-B and caveolin-1 in Hep3B cells, which enhanced Hep3B cell invasiveness. Furthermore, MHCC97H cell invasiveness was significantly decreased in cells in which MIM-B and caveolin-1 expression was inhibited. Additionally, we found that MIM-B and caveolin-1 were expressed at higher levels in HCC tissues than in paired normal tissues. Moreover, HCC patients with MIM-B and caveolin-1 up-regulation experienced significantly worse outcomes than controls (<i>P</i> < 0.001), and HCC patients with high MIM-B and caveolin-1 expression levels often developed pulmonary metastasis (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Conclusions: MIM-B combined with caveolin-1 promotes metastasis of HCC, and elevated MIM-B and caveolin-1 expression levels are associated with a poor prognosis in HCC patients; therefore, MIM-B and caveolin-1 may represent novel targets for the diagnosis and treatment of HCC.","Plasmid Construction, RT-qPCR, Western Blotting, Co-Immunoprecipitation, Immunofluorescent Staining Method, Confocal Microscopy, Immunohistochemistry Staining Method",Hepatocellular Carcinoma,Liver,Not Applicable,Open Access

However, most patients either do not initially respond or do not exhibit durable responses due to primary or adaptive/acquired immune resistance mechanisms of the tumor microenvironment. These suppressive programs are myriad, different between patients with ostensibly the same cancer type, and can harness multiple cell types to reinforce their stability. Consequently, the overall benefit of monotherapies remains limited. Cutting-edge technologies now allow for extensive tumor profiling, which can be used to define tumor cell intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of primary and/or acquired immune resistance, herein referred to as features or feature sets of immune resistance to current therapies. We propose that cancers can be characterized by immune resistance archetypes, comprised of five feature sets encompassing known immune resistance mechanisms. Archetypes of resistance may inform new therapeutic strategies that concurrently address multiple cell axes and/or suppressive mechanisms, and clinicians may consequently be able to prioritize targeted therapy combinations for individual patients to improve overall efficacy and outcomes.","Immunotherapy, Next Generation Sequencing","Melanoma, Glioblastoma",Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access

The dire prognosis of PDAC warrants new strategies to improve the outcomes of patients, and early detection has garnered significant attention. However, early detection of PDAC is most often incidental, emphasizing the importance of developing new early detection screening strategies. Due to the low incidence of the disease in the general population, much of the focus for screening has turned to individuals at high risk of PDAC.

In more advanced and aggressive tumors, however, the multiclonal landscape develops into competing dominant and minor clones accompanied by a disordered microenvironment. We demonstrate that this dominant/minor landscape is associated with differential immunoediting, in which minor clones are marked by an increased expression of IFNγ-response genes and the T cell-activating chemokines Cxcl9 and Cxcl11.

In many cancers, these mechanisms have been observed to induce dynamic switching between two or more cell states, which commonly show differential responses to drug treatments. To understand how these cancers evolve over time, and how they respond to treatment, we need to understand the state-dependent rates of cell proliferation and phenotypic switching. In this work, we propose a rigorous statistical framework for estimating these parameters, using data from commonly performed cell line experiments, where phenotypes are sorted and expanded in culture. The framework explicitly models the stochastic dynamics of cell division, cell death and phenotypic switching, and it provides likelihood-based confidence intervals for the model parameters. The input data can be either the fraction of cells or the number of cells in each state at one or more time points. Through a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we show that when cell fraction data is used, the rates of switching may be the only parameters that can be estimated accurately. On the other hand, using cell number data enables accurate estimation of the net division rate for each phenotype, and it can even enable estimation of the state-dependent rates of cell division and cell death. We conclude by applying our framework to a publicly available dataset.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access

Using this platform, cancer cells expressing ICAM-1 are shown to form a fibrinogen-dependent bridge and transmigrate through the endothelium more effectively. Cancer cells are also demonstrated to interact with fibrin thrombi, using them to adhere, spread, and enhance their extravasation efficiency. Finally, thrombin is also shown to enhance cancer cell extravasation.

Cells can sense environmental stiffness via myosin-generated pulling forces acting on F-actin, which is in turn mechanically coupled to the environment via adhesive proteins, akin to a clutch in a drivetrain. In this ""motor-clutch"" framework, the force transmitted depends on the complex interplay of motor, clutch, and environmental properties. Previous mean-field analysis of the motor-clutch model identified the conditions for optimal stiffness for maximal force transmission via a dimensionless number that combines motor-clutch parameters. However, in this and other previous mean-field analyses, the motor-clutch system is assumed to have balanced motors and clutches and did not consider force-dependent clutch reinforcement and catch bond behavior. Here, we generalize the motor-clutch analytical framework to include imbalanced motor-clutch regimes, with clutch reinforcement and catch bonding, and investigate optimality with respect to all parameters. We found that traction force is strongly influenced by clutch stiffness, and we discovered an optimal clutch stiffness that maximizes traction force, suggesting that cells could tune their clutch mechanical properties to perform a specific function. The results provide guidance for maximizing the accuracy of cell-generated force measurements via molecular tension sensors by designing their mechanosensitive linker peptide to be as stiff as possible. In addition, we found that, on rigid substrates, the mean-field analysis identifies optimal motor properties, suggesting that cells could regulate their myosin repertoire and activity to maximize force transmission. Finally, we found that clutch reinforcement shifts the optimum substrate stiffness to larger values, whereas the optimum substrate stiffness is insensitive to clutch catch bond properties.

To address this need, we have developed PhylinSic, a method that reconstructs the phylogenetic relationships among cells linked to their gene expression profiles from single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data. This method calls nucleotide bases using a probabilistic smoothing approach and then estimates a phylogenetic tree using a Bayesian modeling algorithm. We showed that PhylinSic identified evolutionary relationships underpinning drug selection and metastasis and was sensitive enough to identify subclones from genetic drift. We found that breast cancer tumors resistant to chemotherapies harbored multiple genetic lineages that independently acquired high K-Ras and β-catenin, suggesting that therapeutic strategies may need to control multiple lineages to be durable.

Though we previously showed that liver radiotherapy (L-RT) for locally advanced ICC is associated with less frequent TRLF and longer overall survival (OS), the role of L-RT for patients with extrahepatic metastatic disease (M1) remains undefined. We sought to compare outcomes for M1 ICC patients treated with and without L-RT. Methods: We reviewed ICC patients that found to have M1 disease at initial diagnosis at a single institution between 2010 and 2021 who received L-RT, matching them with an institutional cohort by propensity score and a National Cancer Database (NCDB) cohort by frequency technique. The median biologically effective dose was 97.5 Gy (interquartile range 80.5-97.9 Gy) for L-RT. Patients treated with other local therapies or supportive care alone were excluded. We analyzed survival with Cox proportional hazard modeling. Results: We identified 61 patients who received L-RT and 220 who received chemotherapy alone. At median follow-up of 11 months after diagnosis, median OS was 9 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 8-11) and 21 months (CI: 17-26) for patients receiving chemotherapy alone and L-RT, respectively. TRLF was the cause of death more often in the patients who received chemotherapy alone compared to those who received L-RT (82% vs. 47%; <i>p</i> = 0.001). On multivariable propensity score-matched analysis, associations with lower risk of death included duration of upfront chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.82; <i>p</i> = 0.005) and receipt of L-RT (HR: 0.40; <i>p</i> = 0.002). The median OS from diagnosis for NCDB chemotherapy alone cohort was shorter than that of the institutional L-RT cohort (9 vs. 22 months; <i>p</i> < 0.001).

In this article, we show that IFN-γ-activated human dermal LECs can robustly reactivate allogeneic human memory CD4+ T cells (hCD4+ TMs), but only when TGF-β signaling is inhibited. We found that in addition to upregulating MHC-II, IFN-γ also induces LECs to upregulate glycoprotein A repetitions predominant, which anchors latent TGF-β to the membrane and potentially inhibits T cell activation. Indeed, hCD4+ TM proliferation was substantially increased when LEC-CD4+ TM cultures were treated with a TGF-β receptor type 1 inhibitor or when glycoprotein A repetitions predominant expression was silenced in LECs. Reactivated hCD4+ TMs were characterized by their proliferation, CD25 expression, and cytokine secretion. CD4+ TM reactivation was dependent on LEC expression of MHC-II, confirming direct TCR engagement. Although CD80 and CD86 were not detected on LECs, the costimulatory molecules OX40L and ICOSL were upregulated upon cytokine stimulation; however, blocking these did not affect CD4+ TM reactivation by LECs. Finally, we found that human dermal LECs also supported the maintenance of Foxp3-expressing hCD4+ TMs independently of IFN-γ-induced MHC-II. Together, these results demonstrate a role for LECs in directly modulating CD4+ TM reactivation under inflammatory conditions and point to LEC-expressed TGF-β as a negative regulator of this activation.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access

Suspension cultures of p53-null THP-1 leukemia-derived cells conform to these trends, despite novel evidence here of genetic heterogeneity and transiently elevated CNV after perturbation. Single-cell DNAseq indeed reveals at least 8 distinct THP-1 aneuploid clones with further intra-clonal variation, suggesting ongoing genetic evolution. Importantly, acute inhibition of the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) produces CNV levels that are typical of high-CNV solid tumors, with subsequent cell death and down-selection to novel CNV. Pan-cancer analyses show p53 inactivation associates with aneuploidy, but leukemias exhibit a weaker trend even though p53 inactivation correlates with poor survival. Overexpression of p53 in THP-1 does not rescue established aneuploidy or LOH but slightly increases cell death under oxidative or confinement stress, and triggers p21, a key p53 target, but without affecting net growth.

Research over the past century has shown that mechanical perturbations of the vascular wall contribute to the formation and progression of atherosclerosis. While the straight part of the artery is exposed to sustained laminar flow and physiological high shear stress, flow near branch points or in curved vessels can exhibit 'disturbed' flow. Clinical studies as well as carefully controlled in vitro analyses have confirmed that these regions of disturbed flow, which can include low shear stress, recirculation, oscillation, or lateral flow, are preferential sites of atherosclerotic lesion formation. Because of their critical role in blood flow homeostasis, vascular endothelial cells (ECs) have mechanosensory mechanisms that allow them to react rapidly to changes in mechanical forces, and to execute context-specific adaptive responses to modulate EC functions.

Methods: In this study, we formed aggregates of MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells next to human microvascular lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC)-lined cavities in type I collagen gels to model breast microtumors and lymphatic vessels, respectively. We tracked invasion and escape of breast microtumors into engineered lymphatics or empty cavities under matched flow rates for up to sixteen days.

Material manipulation in an array of 192 hanging drops induces cells to self-assemble into inside-out organoids where an adipose tissue core is enveloped by a cell-produced basement membrane, indicated by laminin V staining and then a continuous layer of mammary epithelial cells. This inverted tissue structure enables investigation of multiple mammary cancer subtypes, with a significantly higher extent of invasion by triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells compared to MCF7 cells. By seeding cancer cells into co-culture around pre-formed organoids with encapsulated preadipocytes/adipocytes, invasion through the epithelium, then into the adipose core is observable through acquisition of confocal image stacks of whole mount specimens. Furthermore, in regions of the connective tissue core where invasion occurs, there is an accumulation of collagen in the microenvironment.

Activation of RAGE by its ligands stimulates multiple signaling pathways that are important in tumor growth and invasion. However, treatment strategies that only target the interaction of RAGE with its ligands are ineffective as cancer therapies due to the abundance and diversity of exogenous RAGE ligands in gliomas.

When admixed directly into the model tumors, lean and obese donor-derived ASCs hastened escape similarly. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the presence of adipose cells, independently of the obesity status of the adipose tissue donor, hastens the escape of human breast cancer cells in multiple models of obesity-associated breast cancer.

We have hypothesized that the increased stiffness directly contributes to the dysregulation of the epithelial cell homeostasis in IBD. Here, we aim to determine the impact of tissue stiffening on the fate and function of the intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Methods: We developed a long-term culture system consisting of 2.5-dimensional intestinal organoids grown on a hydrogel matrix with tunable stiffness. Single-cell RNA sequencing provided stiffness-regulated transcriptional signatures of the ISCs and their differentiated progeny. YAP-knockout and YAP-overexpression mice were used to manipulate YAP expression. In addition, we analyzed colon samples from murine colitis models and human IBD samples to assess the impact of stiffness on ISCs in vivo. Results: We demonstrated that increasing the stiffness potently reduced the population of LGR5<sup>+</sup> ISCs and KI-67<sup>+</sup>-proliferating cells. Conversely, cells expressing the stem cell marker, olfactomedin-4, became dominant in the crypt-like compartments and pervaded the villus-like regions. Concomitantly, stiffening prompted the ISCs to preferentially differentiate toward goblet cells. Mechanistically, stiffening increased the expression of cytosolic YAP, driving the extension of olfactomedin-4<sup>+</sup> cells into the villus-like regions, while it induced the nuclear translocation of YAP, leading to preferential differentiation of ISCs toward goblet cells. Furthermore, analysis of colon samples from murine colitis models and patients with IBD demonstrated cellular and molecular remodeling reminiscent of those observed in vitro. Conclusions: Collectively, our findings highlight that matrix stiffness potently regulates the stemness of ISCs and their differentiation trajectory, supporting the hypothesis that fibrosis-induced gut stiffening plays a direct role in epithelial remodeling in IBD.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access

To investigate this, we developed a live-cell method to measure changes in chromosome numbers. We edited constitutive genes with GFP or RFP tags on single alleles and discovered that cells that lose Chromosome reporters (ChReporters) become non-fluorescent. We applied our new tools to confined mitosis and to inhibition of the putative tumor suppressor myosin-II. We quantified compression of mitotic chromatin in vivo and demonstrated that similar compression in vitro resulted in cell death, but also rare and heritable ChReptorter loss. Myosin-II suppression rescued lethal multipolar divisions and maximized ChReporter loss during three-dimensional (3D) compression and two-dimensional (2D) lateral confinement, but not in standard 2D culture. ChReporter loss was associated with chromosome mis-segregation, rather than just the number of divisions, and loss in vitro and in mice was selected against in subsequent 2D cultures. Inhibition of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) caused ChReporter loss in 2D culture, as expected, but not during 3D compression, suggesting a SAC perturbation.

Here, we investigated whether the persistent secretion of inflammatory factors in HIV-positive patients on antiretroviral therapy could enhance cancer signaling in HPV-infected cervical cells <i>via</i> endocrine mechanisms. We integrated previously reported HIV-induced secreted inflammatory factors (Hi-SIFs), HIV and HPV virus-human protein interactions, and cervical cancer patient genomic data using network propagation to understand the pathways underlying disease development in HPV/HIV coinfection. Our results pinpointed the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway to be enriched at the interface between Hi-SIFs and HPV-host molecular networks, in alignment with PI3K pathway mutations being prominent drivers of HPV-associated, but HIV independent, cervical cancer development. Furthermore, we experimentally stimulated cervical cells with 14 Hi-SIFs to assess their ability to activate PI3K-AKT signaling.

However, few biological matrices enable good print fidelity, while simultaneously facilitate cell viability, proliferation, and migration. Here, a new microporogen-structured (µPOROS) matrix for embedded bioprinting is introduced, in which matrix rheology, printing behavior, and porosity are tailored by adding sacrificial microparticles composed of a gelatin-chitosan complex to a prepolymer collagen solution. To demonstrate its utility, a 3D tumor model is created via embedded printing of a murine melanoma cell ink within the µPOROS collagen matrix at 4 °C. The collagen matrix is subsequently crosslinked around the microparticles upon warming to 21 °C, followed by their melting and removal at 37 °C. This process results in a µPOROS matrix with a fibrillar collagen type-I network akin to that observed in vivo. Printed tumor cells remain viable and proliferate, while antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells incorporated in the matrix migrate to the tumor site, where they induce cell death.
