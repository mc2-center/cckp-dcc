The proposed design uses a utility function to quantify efficacy-toxicity trade-offs, and a Bayesian model with spike and slab prior distributions for the subgroup effect on toxicity and efficacy to guide dosing and to facilitate identifying either subgroup-specific OBDs or a common OBD depending on the resulting trial data. In a simulation study, we find the proposed design performs nearly as well as a design that ignores subgroups when the dose-toxicity and dose-efficacy relationships are the same in both subgroups, and nearly as well as a design with independent dose-finding within each subgroup when these relationships differ across subgroups. In other words, the proposed adaptive design performs similarly to the design that would be chosen if investigators possessed foreknowledge about whether the dose-toxicity and/or dose-efficacy relationship differs across two prespecified subgroups. Thus, the proposed design may be effective for OBD selection when uncertainty exists about whether the OBD differs in two prespecified subgroups.",,,,,Open Access

Soluble PD-L1 is found in patient sera and can bind PD-1 but fails to suppress T cell function. Here, we show that PD-1 function is reduced when mechanical support on ligand is removed. Mechanistically, cells exert forces to PD-1 and prolong bond lifetime at forces <7 pN (catch bond) while accelerate dissociation at forces >8pN (slip bond). Molecular dynamics of PD-1-PD-L2 complex suggests force may cause relative rotation and translation between the two molecules yielding distinct atomic contacts not observed in the crystal structure. Compared to wild-type, PD-1 mutants targeting the force-induced distinct interactions maintain the same binding affinity but suppressed/eliminated catch bond, lowered rupture force, and reduced inhibitory function. Our results uncover a mechanism for cells to probe the mechanical support of PD-1-PD-Ligand bonds using endogenous forces to regulate PD-1 signaling.",,,,,Open Access

The genetic and molecular diversity between patients often results in variation in the antigens present on cancer cell surfaces. As a result, recent research has focused on personalized cancer vaccines. Although promising, this strategy suffers from time-consuming production, high cost, inaccessibility, and targeting of a limited number of tumor antigens. Instead, we explore an antigen-agnostic polymeric in situ cancer vaccination platform for treating blood malignancies, in our model here with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Rather than immunizing against specific antigens or targeting adjuvant to specific cell-surface markers, this platform leverages a characteristic metabolic and enzymatic dysregulation in cancer cells that produces an excess of free cysteine thiols on their surfaces. These thiols increase in abundance after treatment with cytotoxic agents such as cytarabine, the current standard of care in AML. The resulting free thiols can undergo efficient disulfide exchange with pyridyl disulfide (PDS) moieties on our construct and allow for in situ covalent attachment to cancer cell surfaces and debris. PDS-functionalized monomers are incorporated into a statistical copolymer with pendant mannose groups and TLR7 agonists to target covalently linked antigen and adjuvant to antigen-presenting cells in the liver and spleen after IV administration. There, the compound initiates an anticancer immune response, including T-cell activation and antibody generation, ultimately prolonging survival in cancer-bearing mice.",,,,,Open Access

Here, we develop a computational method, a multiomic data integration (MUDI) algorithm, which integrates scHi-C and scRNA-seq data to precisely define the 3D-regulated and biological-context dependent cell subpopulations or topologically integrated subpopulations (TISPs). We demonstrate its algorithmic utility on the publicly available and newly generated scHi-C and scRNA-seq data. We then test and apply MUDI in a breast cancer cell model system to demonstrate its biological-context dependent utility. We find the newly defined topologically conserved associating domain (CAD) is the characteristic single-cell 3D chromatin structure and better characterizes chromatin domains in single-cell resolution. We further identify 20 TISPs uniquely characterizing 3D-regulated breast cancer cellular states. We reveal two of TISPs are remarkably resemble to high cycling breast cancer persister cells and chromatin modifying enzymes might be functional regulators to drive the alteration of the 3D chromatin structures.

Here, we show that the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) purified from Escherichia coli undergoes liquid-liquid demixing in vitro. An emergent property of the resultant condensates is to generate parallel MT bundles when incubated with free tubulin and GTP in vitro. We demonstrate that MT bundles emerge from CPC droplets with protruding minus ends that then grow into long and tapered MT structures. During this growth, we found that the CPC in these condensates apparently reorganize to coat and bundle the resulting MT structures. CPC mutants attenuated for liquid-liquid demixing or MT binding prevented the generation of parallel MT bundles in vitro and reduced the number of MTs present at spindle midzones in HeLa cells. Our data demonstrate that an in vitro biochemical activity to produce MT bundles emerges after the concentration of the CPC and provides models for how cells generate parallel-bundled MT structures that are important for the assembly of the mitotic spindle. Moreover, these data suggest that cells contain MT-organizing centers that generate MT bundles that emerge with the opposite polarity from centrosomes.",,,,,Open Access

The immune system, which has a central role in many diseases, is highly heterogeneous between individuals, and thus poses a major challenge for this technology. In February 2023, an international group of experts convened for two days to discuss these challenges related to immune digital twins. The group consisted of clinicians, immunologists, biologists, and mathematical modelers, representative of the interdisciplinary nature of medical digital twin development.

To functionally evaluate the impact of mtDNA variants on tumor growth and metastasis, we developed an enhanced cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) generation protocol and established isogenic human melanoma cybrid lines with wild-type mtDNA or pathogenic mtDNA mutations with partial or complete loss of mitochondrial oxidative function. Cybrids with homoplasmic levels of pathogenic mtDNA reliably established tumors despite dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation. However, these mtDNA variants disrupted spontaneous metastasis from primary tumors and reduced the abundance of circulating tumor cells. Migration and invasion of tumor cells were reduced, indicating that entry into circulation is a bottleneck for metastasis amid mtDNA dysfunction. Pathogenic mtDNA did not inhibit organ colonization following intravenous injection. In heteroplasmic cybrid tumors, single-cell analyses revealed selection against pathogenic mtDNA during melanoma growth. Collectively, these findings experimentally demonstrate that functional mtDNA is favored during melanoma growth and supports metastatic entry into the blood.",,,,,Open Access

Nevertheless, further clinical implementation has been limited by high variability in patient response to different immunotherapeutic agents. These treatments currently do not have reliable predictors of efficacy and may lead to side effects. The future development of additional immunotherapy options and the prediction of patient-specific response to treatment require advanced screening platforms associated with accurate and rapid data interpretation. Advanced engineering approaches ranging from sequencing and gene editing, to tumor organoids engineering, bioprinted tissues, and organs-on-a-chip systems facilitate the screening of cancer immunotherapies by recreating the intrinsic and extrinsic features of a tumor and its microenvironment. High-throughput platform development and progress in artificial intelligence can also improve the efficiency and accuracy of screening methods.

Here, we find that nucleotide depletion and DNA replication stress drive differentiation in human and murine normal and transformed hematopoietic systems, including patient-derived acute myeloid leukemia (AML) xenografts. These cell state transitions begin during S phase and are independent of ATR/ATM checkpoint signaling, double-stranded DNA break formation, and changes in cell cycle length. In systems where differentiation is blocked by oncogenic transcription factor expression, replication stress activates primed regulatory loci and induces lineage-appropriate maturation genes despite the persistence of progenitor programs. Altering the baseline cell state by manipulating transcription factor expression causes replication stress to induce genes specific for alternative lineages. The ability of replication stress to selectively activate primed maturation programs across different contexts suggests a general mechanism by which changes in metabolism can promote lineage-appropriate cell state transitions.",,,,"GSE211065, GSE172335, GSE172296, GSE172299, GSE262392, GSE172300, GSE172333",Open Access

Similar patterns were observed using FLIM with significant increases in FAD intensity, redox ratio, and NAD(P)H lifetime. The lactate/pyruvate ratio was strongly correlated to NAD(P)H lifetime, consistent with the role of NADH as an electron donor for the glycolytic pathway, suggestive of an overall upregulation of metabolism (both glycolytic and oxidative), for the 4T07 and 4T1 cell lines compared to the non-metastatic 67NR cell line. <b>Conclusions</b>: These findings support a complementary role for HP-MRS and FLIM enabled by a novel collagen gel bioreactor system to investigate metastatic potential and cancer metabolism.",,,,,Open Access

This excess area manifests as folds/wrinkles in the nuclear surface in rounded cells and allows facile nuclear flattening during cell spreading without any changes in nuclear volume or surface area. When the lamina becomes smooth and taut, it is inextensible, and supports a surface tension.

Additionally, several ZFPs associate with their targets at both the DNA and RNA levels. We highlight ZNF277, a C2H2 ZFP that binds thousands of RNA targets and acts as a multi-functional RBP. We also show that ZNF473 is a DNA/RNA-associated protein that regulates the expression and splicing of cell cycle genes. Our results reveal diverse roles for ZFPs in transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation.",,,,,Open Access

Using 16,049 necropsy records for 292 species spanning three clades of tetrapods (amphibians, sauropsids, and mammals), we found that neoplasia and malignancy prevalence increases with adult mass (contrary to Peto's paradox) and somatic mutation rate but decreases with gestation time. The relationship between adult mass and malignancy prevalence was only apparent when we controlled for gestation time. Evolution of cancer susceptibility appears to have undergone sudden shifts followed by stabilizing selection. Outliers for neoplasia prevalence include the common porpoise (<1.3%), the Rodrigues fruit bat (<1.6%), the black-footed penguin (<0.4%), ferrets (63%), and opossums (35%). Discovering why some species have particularly high or low levels of cancer may lead to a better understanding of cancer syndromes and novel strategies for the management and prevention of cancer. Significance: Evolution has discovered mechanisms for suppressing cancer in a wide variety of species. By analyzing veterinary necropsy records, we can identify species with exceptionally high or low cancer prevalence.

It is hypothesized that patterns of collagen evolve as a mechanism of immune escape, but the exact nature of immune-collagen interactions is poorly understood. Spatial data quantifying collagen fiber alignment in squamous cell carcinomas indicates that late-stage disease is associated with highly aligned fibers. Our computational modeling framework discriminates between two hypotheses: immune cell migration that moves (1) parallel or (2) perpendicular to collagen fiber orientation. The modeling recapitulates immune-extracellular matrix interactions where collagen patterns provide immune protection, leading to an emergent inverse relationship between disease stage and immune coverage. Here, computational modeling provides important mechanistic insights by defining a kernel cell-cell interaction function that considers a spectrum of local (cell-scale) to global (tumor-scale) spatial interactions. Short-range interaction kernels provide a mechanism for tumor cell survival under conditions with strong Allee effects, while asymmetric tumor-immune interaction kernels lead to poor immune response.

Image-localized histopathology was previously used to validate FTB maps derived from a reference DSC-MR imaging protocol by using preload, a moderate flip angle (MFA, 60°), and postprocessing leakage correction. Recently, a DSC-MR imaging protocol with a low flip angle (LFA, 30°) with no preload was shown to provide leakage-corrected relative CBV (rCBV) equivalent to the reference protocol. This study aimed to identify the rCBV thresholds for the LFA protocol that generate the most accurate FTB maps, concordant with those obtained from the reference MFA protocol. Materials and methods: Fifty-two patients with grade-IV glioblastoma who had prior surgical resection and received chemotherapy and radiation therapy were included in the study. Two sets of DSC-MR imaging data were collected sequentially first by using LFA protocol with no preload, which served as the preload for the subsequent MFA protocol. Standardized relative CBV maps (sRCBV) were obtained for each patient and coregistered with the anatomic postcontrast T1-weighted images. The reference MFA-based FTB maps were computed by using previously published sRCBV thresholds (1.0 and 1.56). A receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was conducted to identify the optimal, voxelwise LFA sRCBV thresholds, and the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the LFA-based FTB maps were computed with respect to the MFA-based reference. Results: The mean sRCBV values of tumors across patients exhibited strong agreement (concordance correlation coefficient = 0.99) between the 2 protocols. Using the ROC analysis, the optimal lower LFA threshold that accurately distinguishes PTRE from tumor recurrence was found to be 1.0 (sensitivity: 87.77%; specificity: 90.22%), equivalent to the ground truth. To identify aggressive tumor regions, the ROC analysis identified an upper LFA threshold of 1.37 (sensitivity: 90.87%; specificity: 91.10%) for the reference MFA threshold of 1.56. Conclusions: For LFA-based FTB maps, an sRCBV threshold of 1.0 and 1.37 can differentiate PTRE from recurrent tumors. FTB maps aid in surgical planning, guiding pathologic diagnosis and treatment strategies in the recurrent setting.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and estimated effect sizes of the targeted AMPA receptor antagonist perampanel on peritumoral hyperexcitability. An open-label trial was performed comparing perampanel with standard of care (SOC) in patients undergoing resection of newly diagnosed radiologic high-grade glioma. Perampanel was administered as a preoperative loading dose followed by maintenance therapy until progressive disease or up to 12 months. SOC treatment involved levetiracetam for 7 days or as clinically indicated. The primary outcome of hyperexcitability was defined by intraoperative electrocorticography high-frequency oscillation (HFO) rates. Seizure freedom and overall survival were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Tissue concentrations of perampanel, levetiracetam, and correlative biomarkers were measured by mass spectrometry. HFO rates were similar between patients treated with perampanel and levetiracetam. The trial was terminated early after a planned interim analysis, and outcomes assessed in 11 patients (seven perampanel treated; four treated with SOC). Over a median 281 days of postenrollment follow-up, 27% of patients had seizures, including 14% maintained on perampanel and 50% treated with SOC. Overall survival in perampanel-treated patients was similar to that in a glioblastoma reference cohort. Glutamate concentrations in surface biopsies were positively correlated with HFO rates in adjacent electrode contacts and were not significantly associated with treatment assignment or drug concentrations. Glioma peritumoral glutamate concentrations correlated with high-gamma oscillation rates. Targeting glutamatergic activity with perampanel achieved similar electrocorticographic hyperexcitability levels as in levetiracetam-treated patients.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access

Designing vaccines and immunotherapies to target peptide-MHCs requires accurate identification of target peptides in infected or cancerous cells or tissue, and may require absolute or relative quantification to identify abundant targets and measure changes in presentation under different treatment conditions. Internal standard parallel reaction monitoring (also known as 'SureQuant') can be used to validate and/or quantify MHC peptides previously identified by using untargeted methods such as data-dependent acquisition. SureQuant MHC has three main use cases: (i) conclusive confirmation of the identities of putative MHC peptides via comparison with an internal synthetic stable isotope labeled (SIL) peptide standard; (ii) accurate relative quantification by using pre-formed heavy isotope-labeled peptide-MHC complexes (hipMHCs) containing SIL peptides as internal controls for technical variation; and (iii) absolute quantification of each target peptide by using different amounts of hipMHCs loaded with synthetic peptides containing one, two or three SIL amino acids to provide an internal standard curve. Absolute quantification can help determine whether the abundance of a peptide-MHC is sufficient for certain therapeutic modalities. SureQuant MHC therefore provides unique advantages for immunologists seeking to confidently validate antigenic targets and understand the dynamics of the MHC repertoire. After synthetic standards are ordered (3-4 weeks), this protocol can be carried out in 3-4 days and is suitable for individuals with mass spectrometry experience who are comfortable with customizing instrument methods.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access

In particular, agent-based models (ABMs) tracking individual agents and their interactions are useful for their flexibility and ability to model complex behaviors. However, ABMs have often been confined to small domains or, when scaled up, have neglected crucial aspects like vasculature. Additionally, the integration into tumor ABMs of precise radiation dose calculations using gold-standard Monte Carlo (MC) methods, crucial in contemporary radiotherapy, has been lacking. Here, we introduce AMBER, an Agent-based fraMework for radioBiological Effects in Radiotherapy that computationally models tumor growth and radiation responses. AMBER is based on a voxelized geometry, enabling realistic simulations at relevant pre-clinical scales by tracking temporally discrete states stepwise. Its hybrid approach, combining traditional ABM techniques with continuous spatiotemporal fields of key microenvironmental factors such as oxygen and vascular endothelial growth factor, facilitates the generation of realistic tortuous vascular trees. Moreover, AMBER is integrated with TOPAS, an MC-based particle transport algorithm that simulates heterogeneous radiation doses. The impact of radiation on tumor dynamics considers the microenvironmental factors that alter radiosensitivity, such as oxygen availability, providing a full coupling between the biological and physical aspects. Our results show that simulations with AMBER yield accurate tumor evolution and radiation treatment outcomes, consistent with established volumetric growth laws and radiobiological understanding. Thus, AMBER emerges as a promising tool for replicating essential features of tumor growth and radiation response, offering a modular design for future expansions to incorporate specific biological traits.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access

Evidence suggests that the BM functions not only as a barrier to tumour invasion but also as an active tumour-suppressing signalling substrate during premalignancy. However, the molecular foundations of such mechanisms have not been elucidated. Here we explore potential tumour-suppressing functions of the BM during precancer evolution, focusing on the expression and function of the extracellular matrix receptor dystroglycan in the pancreas and pancreatic disease. We show that the dystroglycan protein is highly expressed in the acinar compartment of the normal pancreas but lower in the ductal compartment. Moreover, there is a strong suppression of dystroglycan protein expression with acinar-to-ductal metaplasia in chronic pancreatitis and in all stages of pancreatic precancer and cancer evolution, from acinar-to-ductal metaplasia to dysplasia to adenocarcinoma. The conditional knockout of dystroglycan in the murine pancreas produced little evidence of developmental or functional deficiency. However, conditional deletion of dystroglycan expression in the context of oncogenic Kras expression led to a clear acceleration of pancreatic disease evolution, including accelerated dysplasia development and decreased survival. These data establish dystroglycan as a suppressor of pancreatic dysplasia development and one that is muted in chronic pancreatitis and at the earliest stages of oncogene-induced transformation. We conclude that dystroglycan is an important mediator of the tumour-suppressing functions of the BM during precancer evolution and that reduced dystroglycan function increases cancer risk, highlighting the dynamics of cell-BM interactions as important determinants of early cancer progression. © 2024 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access

Initial growth is exponential, then decelerates as the population approaches its limit size, i.e., the carrying capacity. In mathematical oncology, the tumor carrying capacity has been postulated to be dynamically evolving as the tumor overcomes several evolutionary bottlenecks and, thus, to be patient specific. As the relative tumor-over-carrying capacity ratio may be predictive and prognostic for tumor growth and treatment response dynamics, it is paramount to estimate it from limited clinical data. We show that exploiting the logistic function's rotation symmetry can help estimate the population's growth rate and carry capacity from fewer data points than conventional regression approaches. We test this novel approach against published pan-cancer animal and human breast cancer data, achieving a 30% to 40% reduction in the time at which subsequent data collection is necessary to estimate the logistic growth rate and carrying capacity correctly.

While it is well established that KRAS mutations drive the activation of oncogenic kinase cascades during pancreatic oncogenesis, the effects of oncogenic KRAS signaling on regulation of phosphatases during this process is not fully appreciated. Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) has been implicated in suppressing KRAS-driven cellular transformation and low PP2A activity is observed in PDAC cells compared to non-transformed cells, suggesting that suppression of PP2A activity is an important step in the overall development of PDAC. In the current study, we demonstrate that KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> induces the expression of an endogenous inhibitor of PP2A activity, Cancerous Inhibitor of PP2A (CIP2A), and phosphorylation of the PP2A substrate, c-MYC. Consistent with these findings, KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> sequestered the specific PP2A subunit responsible for c-MYC degradation, B56α, away from the active PP2A holoenzyme in a CIP2A-dependent manner. During PDAC initiation in vivo, knockout of B56α promoted KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> tumorigenesis by accelerating acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and the formation of PanIN lesions. The process of ADM was attenuated ex vivo in response to pharmacological re-activation of PP2A utilizing direct small molecule activators of PP2A (SMAPs).

Although micronuclei accumulate DNA double-strand breaks and replication defects throughout interphase, how chromosomes undergo shattering remains unresolved. Using CRISPR-Cas9 screens, we identify a non-canonical role of the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway as a driver of chromothripsis. Inactivation of the FA pathway suppresses chromosome shattering during mitosis without impacting interphase-associated defects within micronuclei. Mono-ubiquitination of FANCI-FANCD2 by the FA core complex promotes its mitotic engagement with under-replicated micronuclear chromosomes. The structure-selective SLX4-XPF-ERCC1 endonuclease subsequently induces large-scale nucleolytic cleavage of persistent DNA replication intermediates, which stimulates POLD3-dependent mitotic DNA synthesis to prime shattered fragments for reassembly in the ensuing cell cycle.
