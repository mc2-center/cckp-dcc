Here, we report on a minimal 3D extracellular matrix (ECM) system wherein both invasive collective migration (ICM) and rotational collective migration (RCM) arise spontaneously from individually seeded epithelial cells of mammary and hepatic origin, regardless of whether they express adherens junctions, and lead to ductal-like and acinar-like structures, respectively. Quantitative microscopy and cellular Potts modeling reveal that initial differences in cell protrusion dynamics and matrix-remodeling localization generate RCM and ICM behavior in confining 3D ECM. Matrix-remodeling activity by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is localized to the base of protrusions in cells that initiate ICM, whereas RCM does not require MMPs and is associated with ITGβ1-mediated remodeling localized globally around the cell body. Further analysis in vitro and in vivo supports the concept that distinct matrix-remodeling strategies encode collective migration behaviors and tissue structure.","Western Blotting, Fluorescence Imaging, Immunohistochemistry Staining Method",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,,Open Access

However, it remains challenging to quantify the stemness-aware cell state of a tumor based on its gene expression profile. Methods: We develop a developmental-status-aware transcriptional decomposition strategy using single-cell RNA-sequencing-derived tissue-specific fetal and adult cell signatures as anchors. We apply our method to various biological contexts, including developing human organs, adult human tissues, experimentally induced differentiation cultures, and bulk human tumors, to benchmark its performance and to reveal novel biology of entangled developmental signaling in oncogenic processes. Results: Our strategy successfully captures complex dynamics in developmental tissue bulks, reveals remarkable cellular heterogeneity in adult tissues, and resolves the ambiguity of cell identities in in vitro transformations. Applying it to large patient cohorts of bulk RNA-seq, we identify clinically relevant cell-of-origin patterns and observe that decomposed fetal cell signals significantly increase in tumors versus normal tissues and metastases versus primary tumors. Across cancer types, the inferred fetal-state strength outperforms published stemness indices in predicting patient survival and confers substantially improved predictive power for therapeutic responses. Conclusions: Our study not only provides a general approach to quantifying developmental-status-aware cell states of bulk samples but also constructs an information-rich, biologically interpretable, cell-state panorama of human cancers, enabling diverse translational applications.","RNA Sequencing, Mathematical Modeling",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,,Open Access

Here we observed that highly metastatic mouse mammary tumours acquired more innervation than did less-metastatic tumours. This enhanced innervation was driven by expression of the axon-guidance molecule SLIT2 in tumour vasculature. Breast cancer cells induced spontaneous calcium activity in sensory neurons and elicited release of the neuropeptide substance P (SP). Using three-dimensional co-cultures and in vivo models, we found that neuronal SP promoted breast tumour growth, invasion and metastasis. Moreover, patient tumours with elevated SP exhibited enhanced lymph node metastatic spread. SP acted on tumoral tachykinin receptors (TACR1) to drive death of a small population of TACR1<sup>high</sup> cancer cells. Single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs) released from dying cells acted on neighbouring tumoural Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) to non-canonically activate a prometastatic gene expression program. This SP- and ssRNA-induced Tlr7 gene expression signature was associated with reduced breast cancer survival outcomes. Therapeutic targeting of this neuro-cancer axis with the TACR1 antagonist aprepitant, an approved anti-nausea drug, suppressed breast cancer growth and metastasis in multiple models. Our findings reveal that tumour-induced hyperactivation of sensory neurons regulates multiple aspects of metastatic progression in breast cancer through a therapeutically targetable neuropeptide/extracellular ssRNA sensing axis.","Murine Model, Viral Transduction, siRNA, Western Blotting, Fluorescence Imaging, qPCR, Flow Cytometry, RNA Sequencing",Breast Carcinoma,Breast,"SRX24613796, GSE267958, SRP508791, SRX24613794, SRX24613789, SRX24613792, SRX24613791, SRX24613795, SRX24613790, SRX24613793",Open Access

To enable tumor epitope-agnostic interrogation of large blood volumes, we developed a high-throughput microfluidic device, depleting hematopoietic cells through high-flow channels and force-amplifying magnetic lenses. Here, we apply this technology to analyze patient-derived leukapheresis products, interrogating a mean blood volume of 5.83 liters from seven patients with metastatic cancer. High CTC yields (mean 10,057 CTCs per patient; range 100 to 58,125) reveal considerable intra-patient heterogeneity. CTC size varies within patients, with 67% overlapping in diameter with WBCs. Paired single-cell DNA and RNA sequencing identifies subclonal patterns of aneuploidy and distinct signaling pathways within CTCs. In prostate cancers, a subpopulation of small aneuploid cells lacking epithelial markers is enriched for neuroendocrine signatures. Pooling of CNV-confirmed CTCs enables whole exome sequencing with high mutant allele fractions. High-throughput CTC enrichment thus enables cell-based liquid biopsy for comprehensive monitoring of cancer.","RNA Sequencing, Droplet Digital PCR",Pan-Cancer,Not Applicable,,Open Access

Currently, most molecular profiling of BC is based on highly invasive biopsy or transurethral tumor resection. Liquid biopsy takes advantage of less-invasive procedures to longitudinally profile disease. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) isolated from blood are one of the key analytes of liquid biopsy. In this study, we developed a protein and mRNA co-analysis workflow for BC CTCs utilizing the graphene oxide (GO) microfluidic chip. The GO chip was conjugated with antibodies against both EpCAM and EGFR to isolate CTCs from 1 mL of blood drawn from BC patients. Following CTC capture, protein and mRNA were analyzed using immunofluorescent staining and ion-torrent-based whole transcriptome sequencing, respectively. Elevated CTC counts were significantly associated with patient disease status at the time of blood draw. We found a count greater than 2.5 CTCs per mL was associated with shorter overall survival. The invasive markers EGFR, HER2, CD31, and ADAM15 were detected in CTC subpopulations. Whole transcriptome sequencing showed distinct RNA expression profiles from patients with or without tumor burden at the time of blood draw. In patients with advanced metastatic disease, we found significant upregulation of metastasis-related and chemotherapy-resistant genes. This methodology demonstrates the capability of GO chip-based assays to identify tumor-related RNA signatures, highlighting the prognostic potential of CTCs in metastatic BC patients.","Fluorescence Imaging, Mathematical Modeling",Bladder Carcinoma,Bladder,,Open Access

Stimulation with controlled low-level electrical fields, such as transcorneal electrical stimulation (TES), has recently been postulated as a therapeutic strategy. With promising results, there is a need for detailed molecular characterization of the therapeutic effects of TES. Methods: Controlled, non-invasive TES was delivered using a custom contact lens electrode to the retinas of Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rats, a model of retinal degeneration. DNA methylation in the retina, brain and cell-free DNA in plasma was assessed by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and gene expression by RNA sequencing. Results: TES induced DNA methylation and gene expression changes implicated in neuroprotection in the retina of RCS rats. We devised an epigenomic-based retinal health score, derived from DNA methylation changes observed with disease progression in RCS rats, and showed that TES improved the epigenomic health of the retina. TES also induced DNA methylation changes in the superior colliculus: the brain which is involved in integrating visual signaling. Lastly, we demonstrated that TES-induced retinal DNA methylation changes were detectable in cell-free DNA derived from plasma. Conclusion: TES induced DNA methylation changes with therapeutic effects, which can be measured in circulation. Based on these changes, we were able to devise a liquid biopsy biomarker for retinal health. These findings shed light on the therapeutic potential and molecular underpinnings of TES, and provide a foundation for the further development of TES to improve the retinal health of patients with degenerative eye diseases.","Murine Model, Bisulfite Sequencing, RNA Sequencing",Retinoblastoma,Eye,,Open Access

Breast cancer organoids are thought to retain tumor characteristics better, but long-term viability of luminal-subtype cases is a persistent challenge. Our goal was to adapt short-term organoids of luminal breast cancer for parallel testing of genetic and pharmacologic perturbations. Methods: We freshly isolated patient-derived cells from luminal tumor scrapes, miniaturized the organoid format into 5 µl replicates for increased throughput, and set an endpoint of 14 days to minimize drift. Therapeutic hormone targeting was mimicked in these ""zero-passage"" organoids by withdrawing β-estradiol and adding 4-hydroxytamoxifen. We also examined sulforaphane as an electrophilic stress and commercial nutraceutical with reported anti-cancer properties. Downstream mechanisms were tested genetically by lentiviral transduction of two complementary sgRNAs and Cas9 stabilization for the first week of organoid culture. Transcriptional changes were measured by RT-qPCR or RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and organoid phenotypes were quantified by serial brightfield imaging, digital image segmentation, and regression modeling of volumetric growth rates. Results: We achieved > 50% success in initiating luminal breast cancer organoids from tumor scrapes and maintaining them to the 14-day zero-passage endpoint. Success was mostly independent of clinical parameters, supporting general applicability of the approach. Abundance of ESR1 and PGR in zero-passage organoids consistently remained within the range of patient variability at the endpoint. However, responsiveness to hormone withdrawal and blockade was highly variable among luminal breast cancer cases tested. Combining sulforaphane with knockout of NQO1 (a phase II antioxidant response gene and downstream effector of sulforaphane) also yielded a breadth of organoid growth phenotypes, including growth inhibition with sulforaphane, growth promotion with NQO1 knockout, and growth antagonism when combined. Conclusions: Zero-passage organoids are a rapid and scalable way to interrogate properties of luminal breast cancer cells from patient-derived material. This includes testing drug mechanisms of action in different clinical cohorts. A future goal is to relate inter-patient variability of zero-passage organoids to long-term outcomes.","RNA Sequencing, RT-qPCR, Viral Transduction, Western Blotting",Breast Carcinoma,Breast,,Open Access

FRET spectrometry protocols currently rely on obtaining spectrally resolved fluorescence data from intensity-based experiments. Another imaging method, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), is a widely used alternative to compute FRET efficiencies for each pixel in an image from the reduction of the fluorescence lifetime of the donors caused by FRET. In FLIM studies of oligomers with different proportions of donors and acceptors, the donor lifetimes may be obtained by fitting the temporally resolved fluorescence decay data with a predetermined number of exponential decay curves. However, this requires knowledge of the number and the relative arrangement of the fluorescent proteins in the sample, which is precisely the goal of FRET spectrometry, thus creating a conundrum that has prevented users of FLIM instruments from performing FRET spectrometry. Here, we describe an attempt to implement FRET spectrometry on temporally resolved fluorescence microscopes by using an integration-based method of computing the FRET efficiency from fluorescence decay curves. This method, which we dubbed <i>time-integrated FRET</i> (or tiFRET), was tested on oligomeric fluorescent protein constructs expressed in the cytoplasm of living cells.

The inner retina resides in a hypoxic environment (2% O<sub>2</sub>) adjacent to the vitreous cavity. Oxygenation levels rapidly increase towards the outer retina (18% O<sub>2</sub>) at the choroid. In addition to retinal stratification, oxygen levels are critical for the health of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which relay visual information from the retina to the brain. Human stem cell derived retinal organoids are being engineered to mimic the structure and function of human retina for applications such as disease modeling, development of therapeutics, and cell replacement therapies. However, rapid degeneration of the retinal ganglion cell layers are a common limitation of human retinal organoid platforms. We report the design of a novel retinal organoid chip (ROC) that maintains a physiologically relevant oxygen gradient and allows the maturation of inner and outer retinal cell phenotypes for human retinal organoids. Our PDMS-free ROC holds 55 individual retinal organoids that were manually seeded, cultured for extended periods (over 150 days), imaged <i>in situ</i>, and retrieved. ROC was designed from first principles of liquid and gas mass transport, and fabricated from biologically- and chemically inert materials using rapid prototyping techniques such as micromachining, laser cutting, 3D printing and bonding. After computational and experimental validation of oxygen gradients, human induced pluripotent stem cell derived retinal organoids were transferred into the ROC, differentiated, cultured and imaged within the chip. ROCs that maintained active perfusion and stable oxygen gradients were successful in inducing higher viability of RGCs within retinal organoids than static controls, or ROC without oxygen gradients. Our physiologically relevant and higher-throughput retinal organoid culture system is well suited for applications in studying developmental perturbations to primate retinogenesis, including those driven by inherited traits, fetal environmental exposure to toxic agents, or acquired by genetic mutations, such as retinoblastoma.","Fluorescence Imaging, Organoid",Retinoblastoma,Eye,,Open Access

The microarchitecture of collagen fibril networks changes during development, aging, and disease. Such changes to microarchitecture are often accompanied by changes in matrix degradability. In a matrix, the pore size and fibril characteristics such as length, diameter, number, orientation, and curvature are the major variables that define the microarchitecture. <i>In vitro</i>, collagen matrices of the same concentration but different microarchitectures also vary in degradation rate. How do different microarchitectures affect matrix degradation? To answer this question, we developed a computational model of collagen degradation. We first developed a lattice model that describes collagen degradation at the scale of a single fibril. We then extended this model to investigate the role of microarchitecture using Brownian dynamics simulation of enzymes in a multi-fibril three dimensional matrix to predict its degradability. Our simulations predict that the distribution of enzymes around the fibrils is non-uniform and depends on the microarchitecture of the matrix. This non-uniformity in enzyme distribution can lead to different extents of degradability for matrices of different microarchitectures. Our simulations predict that for the same enzyme concentration and collagen concentration, a matrix with thicker fibrils degrades more than that with thinner fibrils. Our model predictions were tested using <i>in vitro</i> experiments with synthetic collagen gels of different microarchitectures. Experiments showed that indeed degradation of collagen depends on the matrix architecture and fibril thickness.

In this study, we posited that combinatorial TSLPRCART and ruxolitinib would have superior activity and first validated potent TSLPRCART-induced inhibition of leukemia proliferation in vitro in CRLF2-rearranged ALL cell lines and in vivo in Ph-like and DS-ALL patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. However, simultaneous TSLPRCART/ruxolitinib or CD19CART/ruxolitinib treatment during initial CART expansion diminished T cell proliferation, blunted cytokine production, and/or facilitated leukemia relapse, which was abrogated by time-sequenced/delayed ruxolitinib co-exposure. Importantly, ruxolitinib co-administration prevented fatal TSLPRCART cytokine-associated toxicity in ALL PDX mice. Upon ruxolitinib withdrawal, TSLPRCART functionality recovered in vivo with clearance of subsequent ALL rechallenge.

Inhibition of RAD51 increased nucleosome clustering. Predictions from polymer models are that chromatin clusters reduce chain mobility and, indeed, we measured reduced motion of individual chromatin loci in cells treated with a RAD51 inhibitor.

Existing approaches use ad hoc fixed experimental designs then train machine learning models to impute unobserved combinations. Here we propose BATCHIE, an orthogonal approach that conducts experiments dynamically in batches. BATCHIE uses information theory and probabilistic modeling to design each batch to be maximally informative based on the results of previous experiments. On retrospective experiments from previous large-scale screens, BATCHIE designs rapidly discover highly effective and synergistic combinations. In a prospective combination screen of a library of 206 drugs on a collection of pediatric cancer cell lines, the BATCHIE model accurately predicts unseen combinations and detects synergies after exploring only 4% of the 1.4M possible experiments. Further, the model identifies a panel of top combinations for Ewing sarcomas, which follow-up validation experiments confirm to be effective, including the rational and translatable top hit of PARP plus topoisomerase I inhibition. These results demonstrate that adaptive experiments can enable large-scale unbiased combination drug screens with a relatively small number of experiments.

Beside surgery, current therapies have narrow clinical benefits with systemic toxicities. FOLFIRINOX is the current standard of care, one component of which is 5- Fluorouracil (5-FU), which causes serious gastrointestinal and hematopoietic toxicities and is vulnerable to resistance mechanisms. Recently, we have developed polymeric fluoropyrimidines (F10, CF10) which unlike 5-FU, are, in principle, completely converted to the thymidylate synthase inhibitory metabolite FdUMP, without generating appreciable levels of ribonucleotides that cause systemic toxicities while displaying much stronger anti-cancer activity. Here, we confirm the potency of CF10 and investigate enhancement of its efficacy through combination with inhibitors in vitro targeting replication stress, a hallmark of PDAC cells. CF10 is 308-times more potent as a single agent than 5-FU and was effective in the nM range in primary patient derived models. Further, we find that activity of CF10, but not 5-FU, is enhanced through combination with inhibitors of ATR and Wee1 that regulate the S and G2 DNA damage checkpoints and can be reversed by addition of dNTPs indicative of CF10 acting, at least in part, through inducing replication stress. Our results indicate CF10 has the potential to supersede the established benefit of 5-FU in PDAC treatment and indicate novel combination approaches that should be validated in vivo and may be beneficial in established regimens that include 5-FU.","Western Blotting, Cell Viability Assay",Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma,Pancreas,,Open Access

Traditionally, this assay relies on two-dimensional (2D) cell culture conditions with colonies counted by fixing and staining protocols. While some groups have converted these to three-dimensional (3D) conditions, these models still utilize 2D-like media compositions containing serum that are incompatible with stem-like cell models such as brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs) that form self-aggregating spheroids in neural stem cell media. BTICs are the preferred patient-derived model system for studying glioblastoma (GBM) as they tend to better retain molecular and phenotypic characteristics of the original tumor tissue. As such, it is important that preclinical radiation studies should be adapted to BTIC conditions. In this study, we describe a series of experimental approaches for performing CFA experiments with BTIC cultures.

There is even confusion about the definition of a clone, which we aim to resolve. The performance and value of the clonal evolution model depends on the empirical extent to which evolutionary processes are involved in cancer, and on its theoretical ability to account for those evolutionary processes. Here, we identify limits in the theoretical performance of the clonal evolution model and provide solutions to overcome those limits.

While intracellular signaling initiates contractile ring assembly during cell division, how mechanical forces coordinate division and their energetic costs remain unclear. Here, we develop an in vitro model where myosin-induced stress drives division-like shape changes in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs, liposomes). Myosin activity is controlled by light patterns globally or locally at the equator. Global activation causes slow, shallow cleavage furrows due to a tug-of-war between the equatorial and polar forces. By contrast, local activation leads to faster, deeper, and symmetric division as equatorial forces dominate. Dissociating the actin cortex at the poles is crucial for inducing significant furrowing. During furrowing, actomyosin flows align actin filaments parallel to the division plane, forming a contractile ring-like structure. Mechanical power is not greatest during contraction, but is maximized just before furrowing. This study reveals the quantitative relationship between force patterning and mechanical energy during division-like shape changes, providing insights into cell division mechanics.","Fluorescence Imaging, Mathematical Modeling",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,,Open Access

Radiation treatment is known to alter immune cell populations within the tumor; however, whether this results in the recruitment of immunosuppressive MDSC populations is not well understood. Here we evaluate the response of circulating MDSC populations in patients treated per standard-of-care cisplatin chemoradiation therapy (CRT) for locally invasive cervical cancer. Methods and materials: Newly diagnosed, treatment-naïve patients with locally advanced cervical cancer were enrolled. Blood samples were collected from patients prior to starting CRT (T<sub>0</sub>), after external beam radiation therapy (T<sub>1</sub>), and after high-dose-rate brachytherapy (T<sub>2</sub>). Samples from each time point were processed, and the prevalence of MDSC subsets was determined using flow cytometry. MDSC populations were identified using Live/Dead-CD11b+CD33+HLA-DR- staining. MDSC subsets were further subdivided into granulocytic (g-, CD15+CD14-), monocytic (m-, CD15-CD14+), or early-MDSCs (e-, CD15-CD14-). Results: Most patients in our study were Caucasian nonsmokers with human papillomavirus-associated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. We saw a trend for increased MDSC frequency in patients with more advanced-stage disease at the time of initiating treatment. MDSCs increase in response to CRT and peak after brachytherapy (T<sub>2</sub>). In particular, the g-MDSC subset increases by 6.44 times relative to the baseline. There was no correlation between MDSC expansion and response to therapy. Conclusion: Our study confirms other reports that circulating MDSCs in patients with cervical cancer increase in response to CRT and are associated with more advanced stages. Additionally, we show that MDSC expansion is driven by the g-MDSC subset. We did not see any correlation between MDSC expansion and treatment response, though this may be because of the limited sample size for this study.",Clinical Study,Cervical Carcinoma,Cervix Uteri,,Open Access

Methods: Theoretical In-silico mathematical assumptions were combined with an in-vitro experimental strategy to investigate alternative radiation regimens. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) brain tumor-initiating cells (BTICs) with differential radiation-sensitivities were tested individually with sham control and three regimens of the same nominal and average dose of 16 Gy (over four fractions), but with altered doses per fraction. Fractions were delivered conventionally (CDF: 4, 4, 4, 4 Gy), or as dynamic dose fractions (DDF) ""ramped down"" (RD: 7, 5, 3, 1 Gy), or DDF ""ramped up"" (RU: 1, 3, 5, 7 Gy), every 4 days.

Results: The proposed method of radiosensitivity assessment allows for longitudinal-interfraction investigation in addition to endpoint analysis. Delivering four-fraction doses in an RD manner proves to be most effective at overcoming acquired radiation resistance in BTICs (Relative cell viability: CDF vs. RD: P < 0.0001; Surviving fraction: CDF: vs. RD: P < 0.0001).

Despite the primarily indirect effect on oncogenesis, HBV is associated with a recurrent genomic phenotype in HCC, suggesting that it impacts the biology of established HCC. Characterization of the interaction of HBV with host proteins and the mechanistic contributions of HBV to HCC initiation and maintenance could provide insights into HCC biology and uncover therapeutic vulnerabilities. Here, we used affinity purification mass spectrometry to comprehensively map a network of 145 physical interactions between HBV and human proteins in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A subset of the host factors targeted by HBV proteins were preferentially mutated in non-HBV-associated HCC, suggesting that their interaction with HBV influences HCC biology. HBV interacted with proteins involved in mRNA splicing, mitogenic signaling, and DNA repair, with the latter set interacting with the HBV oncoprotein X (HBx). HBx remodeled the PP2A phosphatase complex by excluding striatin regulatory subunits from the PP2A holoenzyme, and the HBx effects on PP2A caused Hippo kinase activation. In parallel, HBx activated mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), which can prevent YAP degradation. mTORC2-mediated upregulation of YAP was observed in human HCC specimens and mouse HCC models and could be targeted with mTOR kinase inhibitors.

Previous investigations have demonstrated promise of using rCBV in classifying tumor grade, elucidating tumor viability after therapy, and differentiating pseudoprogression and pseudoresponse. However, the quantification and reproducibility of rCBV measurements across patients, devices, and software remain a critical barrier to routine or clinical trial use of longitudinal DSC MRI in patients with gliomas. To address this limitation, the RSNA DSC MRI Biomarker Committee of the Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers Alliance developed a Profile that defines statistics-based claims for the precision of longitudinal measurements. Although rCBV is the clinical marker of interest, the Profile focused on the reproducibility of the measured quantitative imaging biomarker, which is the area under the contrast agent concentration-time curve (AUC) normalized by the mean value of normal-appearing contralateral white matter tissue (tissue-normalized AUC values). Based on previous reports of within-subject coefficient of variation (wCV) in the tissue-normalized AUC values for enhancing gliomas (wCV = 0.31), an increase of 182% or more with respect to the baseline tissue-normalized AUC value indicates that an increase has occurred with 95% confidence. In contrast, a decrease of 64% or more with respect to baseline suggests that a decrease has occurred with 95% confidence. Similarly, an increase of 399% or more in the tissue-normalized AUC values in normal brain gray matter tissue (wCV = 0.40) suggests that an increase has occurred with 95% confidence, whereas a decrease of 80% or more with respect to baseline suggests that a decrease has occurred with 95% confidence.

Marrow-infiltrating lymphocytes (MIL) have demonstrated antitumor reactivity preclinically. Successful expansion of TIL/MIL has not been reported across pediatric solid tumor histologies. The objective of this study was to demonstrate successful expansion of TIL from pediatric solid tumors for translation in an adoptive cell therapy (ACT) treatment strategy. Methods: A prospective study of TIL/MIL expansion was performed on solid tumors of pediatric patients undergoing standard-of-care procedures. TIL/MIL expansions were performed in the presence of high-dose interleukin 2. To demonstrate a full-scale expansion to clinically-relevant cell doses for TIL therapy, initial TIL culture was followed by a rapid expansion protocol for select patients. Expanded specimens were analyzed for phenotype by flow cytometry and for anti-tumor reactivity by the interferon-gamma release assay. Results: Eighteen tumor samples were obtained. Initial TIL cultures were successfully generated from 14/18 samples (77.7%). A median of 5.52 × 107 (range: 2.5 × 106-3.23 × 108) cells were produced from initial cultures, with 46.9% expressing a CD3 phenotype (46.9%). Eight samples underwent rapid expansion, demonstrating a median 458-fold expansion and a CD3 phenotype of 98%. Initial MIL cultures were successfully generated from five samples, with a predominantly CD3 phenotype (45.2%). Sufficient tumor tissue was only available for seven TIL samples to be tested for reactivity; none demonstrated responsiveness to autologous tumor. Conclusions: TIL and MIL expansion from pediatric solid tumors was successful, including the full-scale expansion process.
