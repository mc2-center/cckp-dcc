We sought to mechanistically understand how metabolism might regulate cell fate decisions and to identify metabolic differentiation agents that might be leveraged therapeutically.  We find that nucleotide – purine, pyrimidine, and deoxynucleotide – depletion leads to AML differentiation by way of replication stress. Modulation of nucleotide pools leads to transcriptional reprogramming, epigenetic remodeling, and initiation of differentiation which is dependent on the myeloid regulating transcription-factor PU.1. By single-cell RNA sequencing and microscopy, we find that reprogramming downstream of nucleotide depletion occurs as cells undergo replication stress and that the cell fate decision is initiated prior to completion of the cell cycle. Together, these findings suggest that nucleotide metabolism is a critical determinant of hematopoietic progenitor cell fate, clarify the coordination of the fate decision with the cell cycle, and expand upon the class of inhibitors that can be developed or repurposed as novel differentiation therapy.","Genome-wide and sublibrary CRISPRi screens were performed in ER-Hoxa9, THP-1, and K562 cells with and without BRQ treatment.",Computational Modeling,Multispecies,Acute Myeloid Leukemia ,Blood,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE211065,,,

Prior bulk HCC subtyping data used bulk transcriptomes, which contained a mixture of parenchymal and stromal contributions. Using cell type–specific spatial transcriptomics techniques to separate cancer cells and endothelial cells applied to a set of 41 resected HCC tissue specimens, we report that the prior Hoshida bulk transcriptional subtyping schema is driven largely by an endothelial fraction, show an alternative tumor-specific schema has potential prognostic value, and use spatially paired ligand-receptor analyses to identify known and novel (LGALS9 tumor-HAVCR2 vessel) signaling relationships that drive HCC biology in a subtype-specific and potentially targetable manner. Our study leverages spatial gene expression profiling technologies to dissect HCC heterogeneity and identify heterogeneous sig- naling relationships between cancer cells and their endothelial cells. Future validation and expansion of these findings may validate novel cancer- endothelial cell interactions and related drug targets.",We used cell type–specific spatial transcriptomics techniques (Nanostring GeoMx) to separate cancer cells and endothelial cells applied to a set of 41 resected HCC tissue specimens.,Computational Modeling,,Hepatocellular Carcinoma,Liver,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE277104,,,
