GrantView,CA184897,Dynamics of Gene and Isoform Regulation during EMT and tumor progression,CA184897,"The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a complex cell-biological program that operates during the progression of carcinoma cells to high-grade malignancy, conferring on these cells many of the attributes associated with aggressive tumors, including the ability to disseminate to distant sites and to seed metastatic colonies. This program is orchestrated by a series of pleiotropically acting master transcription factors (EMT- TFs) that organize the complex changes in gene expression causing the replacement of a large cohort of epithelial cell proteins with those associated with the mesenchymal cell state. A major, critical level of control required for expression of the aggressive mesenchymal state is poorly understood however: the precursors of many of the mRNAs whose expression changes during the EMT also undergo alternative splicing (AS) that confer on resulting mature, processed mRNAs altered properties, including changes in stability, protein-coding information, and responsiveness to microRNA-mediated inhibition. The current fragmentary insights into the effects of AS on the execution of the EMT program make it impossible to form a reasonably complete understanding of how this critical cell-biological program is affected. The proposed research will begin by enumerating the hundreds of AS events that occur in response to several alternative mechanisms of inducing an EMT program both in cultured cells and in a living tissue. Having done so, bioinformatics algorithms will be employed to determine the sequences adjacent to involved splice sites. Thereafter, using the known nucleotide-recognizing properties of the large array of already-characterized RNA- binding, splice-regulating proteins, predictions will be made by these algorithms about the identities of the splice-regulators that are likely to b responsible for the observed large-scale shifts in AS occurring during passage through an EMT. This experimental strategy should yield the identities of key regulators of AS that are likely to b as important functionally as the EMT-TFs in executing the EMT program. Experimental tests designed to functionally test the candidacies of these AS factors will be performed. These tests will gauge whether the forced or blocked expression of these factors affect execution of critical components of the EMT program, and whether, as predicted, such imposed changes in AS factor expression affect the production of key EMT-associated proteins, i.e., proteins that play key roles in the expression of the epithelial versus mesenchymal cell phenotypes observed during malignant progression. This work also has the potential to identify novel biomarkers of the EMT program that are applicable, for example, for the detections of stem cells in a variety of epithelial tissues.",U01,"Metastasis, Heterogeneity","Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts Institute of Technology","BIDMC, MGH, MIT","Frank B.

These tumors are the most common central nervous system malignancies in childhood, and there is a pressing need for better therapies. Current survival rates range from 30 – 80% depending on subgroup, and nearly all survivors have impaired neurological and neurocognitive function. Extensive genomic analysis of medulloblastomas, the most common embryonal tumors, failed to identify “driver genes” that could explain the origin of most tumors or suggest new strategies.

Taking into account the emerging paradigm that the reprogrammed intratumoral stromal cells contribute to carcinogenesis, we are employing integrated experimental and computational approaches to identify tumor-stromal crosstalk pathways that drive NSCLC progression in mice and humans. We are developing a multicellular crosstalk signaling network modeling and visualization tool, which is being applied to multicellular RNAseq data to identify tumor-stroma crosstalk pathways. Genes involved in these signaling mechanisms constitute potential candidates, which are being validated in rapid in vitro coculture assays, and their mechanistic and therapeutic potential is being assessed in genetically engineered NSCLC models.

A fundamental and long-standing question in cancer research is what happens at the genomic level to change a typical cell from a normal phenotype into a malignant one. The linkage between some types of cancer and gene mutations is apparent, but that phenomenon is not observed in every class of tumor cell. How, then is gene expression so radically altered in tumor cells?

GrantView,CA195469,Intratumor heterogeneity underlying treatment resistance in HER2+ breast tumors,CA195469,"Despite improved treatment strategies, inherent and acquired resistance to HER2-targeted therapies is common and inevitably lead to disease progression and cancer-related deaths. PIK3CA mutations occur in ~40% of HER2+ tumors and have been associated with resistance to treatment. To explore intratumor heterogeneity for HER2 and PIK3CA mutation in HER2+ tumors and the potential role of this in treatment resistance, we have developed a technique, STAR-FISH (Specific To Allele pcR FISH) that allows for the combined detection of point mutations and copy number gain in intact tissue samples at the single cell level. By applying STAR-FISH to HER2+ tumors before and after neoadjuvant therapy, we found that PIK3CA mutation and HER2 amplification do not always co-occur in the same cell but can be present in distinct subpopulations within tumors. Post-treatment residual tumors have higher fraction of mutant PIK3CA cells with a concomitant decrease in the relative ratio of cells with HER2 amplification. Patients with significant differene in cell type diversity between pre and post-treatment samples have shorter disease-specific survival than those with no change. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that 1) not all somatic mutations that have been reported to occur in a given tumor are present in the same tumor cell but some may represent genetically divergent clones within tumors, (2) the combination of mutations within the same cell and within the same tumor is not random, but reflect cooperation among pathways and among clones, and (3) the presence of a combination of mutations within the same cell versus in different clones in the same tumor will have different functional and clinical consequences. We propose three specific aims to test these hypotheses: Aim 1. Analyze intratumor subclonal and cellular genetic diversity in HER2+ breast tumors. Aim 2. Develop and characterize experimental models of intratumor heterogeneity in HER2+ breast cancer. Aim 3. Develop mathematical models to infer the evolution of HER2+ tumors during treatment.

GrantView,CA199315,Integrative approach to heterogeneity in breast cancer metastasis,CA199315,"Despite major advances in understanding the molecular and genetic basis of cancer, disease progression to metastasis remains the cause of >90% of cancer-related mortality. Understanding the mechanisms underlying metastasis initiation is critical for the development of new therapeutic strategies specifically to diagnose, target and prevent progression to metastatic disease. However, the identity of metastasis-initiating cells in human breast cancer remains elusive. We propose to use an integrative approach using a variety of state-of-the-art single cell multi-parametric, analytical techniques to probe heterogeneity during metastasis of human breast cancer at single cell resolution. We have previously found heterogeneity in micro- and macro-metastatic cells from human patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and we will exploit these PDXs grown in immunodeficient mice to probe heterogeneity in triple negative, estrogen receptor-positive and HER2-positive human breast cancers and their metastases. We propose to determine differentiation states for triple negative breast cancers and their early and advanced metastasis using single cell profiling techniques to test the hypothesis that distinct states confer therapeutic resistance and metastatic capabilities. We will compare the differentiation states of the triple negative cancers with those of estrogen receptor positive and HER2 positive breast cancers and their early and advanced metastases at the single cell level to determine the properties of states that confer therapeutic resistance and metastatic capabilities. The RNA studies will be complemented by protein analysis using single cell mass cytometry. After determining the self-renewal and differentiation properties of the metastatic cells, we will test their response to targeted therapy by transplantation in vivo and by tumor cell sphere assays in culture. We will then validate the predictions by examining human breast cancer specimens. Through this systems biology approach we plan to develop a global understanding of the events leading to breast cancer metastasis. Understanding these functions in molecular detail could lead to prevention regimes for patients at high risk of developing breast cancer so that their tumors do not metastasize, biomarkers of progression for patients who are newly diagnosed with cancer and new therapeutic approaches for patients at high risk of developing metastases by either suppressing the outgrowth of micro-metastases or by killing them outright.",U01,"Heterogeneity, Microenvironment",University of California; San Francisco,UCSF,"Zena Werb, Paul T.

GrantView,CA202123,Epithelial layer jamming in breast cancer cell migration,CA202123,"If cancer cells did not migrate –and instead just stayed put– then cancer in most instances would be a more manageable disease. But cancer cells do migrate, and that migration accounts for much of cancer’s morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, we understand little about how, why, and when this aberrant cellular migration plays out. Cancer cells tend to migrate not as individual units but rather as a cellular collective –in multicellular strings, ducts, strands and clusters. We propose that a controlling factor in that collective cellular migration is a newly discovered phenomenon called “cell jamming”. From cars streaming in highway traffic to coffee beans flowing in a chute at the supermarket to cells migrating within a living tissue, a wide variety of collective systems –both inert and living– are now known to have the capacity to jam. Within a living cell cluster, in particular, cells can jam to become quiescent, solid-like, and virtually frozen in place, or instead can unjam to become mobilized, fluid-like, and migratory. In the physiological case of healthy tissues, we do not yet know if the transition from a jammed to an unjammed state is an essential part of organogenesis, pattern formation, and wound healing. And in the pathophysiological case of malignant tissues, neither do we know if the transition from a jammed to an unjammed state is a prerequisite for invasion or metastasis. We do know, however, that the discovery of cell jamming suggests a physical picture of collective cellular migration that is substantially richer than previously recognized, and we propose here to investigate cell jamming in the context of early stages of breast tumor progression. Breast cancer is representative of the wider class of cancers of epithelial origin –carcinomas– that account for the vast majority of cancers and cancer deaths.<br><br>Do epithelial cells in some circumstances behave in one way –jammed, solid-like and aggregated with little possibility of mutual cell rearrangement, escape or invasion– while in other circumstances they behave in another –unjammed, fluid-like, disaggregated and invasive? We address this question in selected breast cancer cell lines, in a variety of extracellular environments that mimic native environments, and across graded stages of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Data derived from a comprehensive suite of novel experimental probes –cellular motions, traction stresses, intercellular stresses and cellular shapes (Figure)– will be critically examined through the lens of a novel quantitative theory of cell jamming. Specific questions include:<br><br>Do cell populations that are jammed correspond to quiescent, lower risk states whereas populations that are unjammed correspond to states that are more motile, more invasive, or more likely to metastasize? Conventional wisdom holds that adhesion molecules tether a cell to its immediate neighbors and thus tend to impede cellular migration. The theory of cell jamming and supporting preliminary data suggest the opposite interpretation –increased cell-cell adhesion facilitates cell unjamming and thereby promotes cellular migration. Is the conventional wisdom overly simplistic and perhaps even misleading? Does the jamming hypothesis force a fundamental rethinking of the mechano-biology of cancer cell migration and metastasis?<br><br>How does the presence of stem-like features within cancer cell sub-populations alter the propensity for cell unjamming? Importantly, the cell jamming hypothesis makes predictions that are mechanistic, non-trivial, and counterintuitive. If supported by the data in the instances of the particular breast cancers to be addressed here, the hope is that the concept of cell jamming may improve understanding and guide novel therapeutic approaches –not only in those particular instances, but also more generally in other cancers of epithelial origin.",U01,"Metastasis, Heterogeneity","Boston University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University","BU, Dartmouth, Harvard",Jeffrey J.

The team is using the frameworks to compare and contrast datasets recording different aspects of a single disease, such as genomic profiles of multiple cell types from the same set of patients, measured more than once by several different methods. By using the complex structure of the datasets, rather than simplifying them as is commonly done, the frameworks enable the separation of patterns of DNA alterations – which occur only in the tumor genomes – from those that occur in the genomes of normal cells in the body, and from variations caused by experimental inconsistencies. The patterns that the team uncovers in the data are expected to offer answers to the open question of the relation between a tumor's genome and a patient's outcome.<br><br>For example, recent comparisons of the genomes of tumor and normal cells from the same sets of ovarian and, separately, glioblastoma brain cancer patients uncovered patterns of DNA copy-number alterations that were found to be correlated with a patient's survival and response to chemotherapy.

GrantView,CA202241,ECM geometrical and mechanical properties modulate RTK signaling,CA202241,"A serious problem with cancer treatment today is the tendency of cancer cells to develop resistance to the drugs we use to destroy them. The devastating result is that all too many cancer patients see their cancer at first respond positively to drug treatment, only to return later with a newfound resistance to the cancer drugs. A combination of discoveries from the Groves lab (physical chemistry, UCB) and the Weaver lab (cancer biology, UCSF) have led to a new insight into how cancer cells acquire this resistance and how we might be able to stop this deadly process.<br><br>Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) somatic mutations and overexpression are found in many aggressive diseases such as non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. RTKs are thus important targets for cancer therapy. However, patients often develop resistance to RTK inhibitors, despite initially robust tumor regression. While this could be due to the emergence of mutated clones, stromal-epithelial interactions also regulate tumor progression and treatment response. In particular, there is a striking heterogeneity in extracellular matrix (ECM) mechanical properties in diseased tissue. Recent work from our groups suggests that ECM modulation of tumor behavior occurs through RTK signaling assemblies (Weaver et al., Cell, 2009; Nature, 2014; Cancer Res., 2014; Groves et al., Science, 2010), extending the mechanistic features of the mechano-signal initiation beyond the well-characterized effect of integrin-mediated adhesion and signaling. It is our thesis that in addition to genetic variation, external spatio-mechanical factors from the ECM are critical contributors to RTK therapy resistance. In this program, we will utilize the expertise of both of our groups to quantitatively characterize and manipulate the mechanical and topographical properties of the cellular microenvironment to understand the effects on RTK signaling (Figure), and its therapeutic inhibition.

To evaluate their potential for translation, we will integrate these dynamic models with clinical trials that will evaluate whether these phenotypic changes can be targeted for therapy. We hypothesize that acquired resistance emerges from selection acting on phenotypes during tumor evolution, and that simultaneously measuring and modeling subclone genotypes and phenotypes will identify new, and testable, therapeutic targets. Selective pressures from therapy and the tumor microenvironment can propel subclones from every patient's tumor along an evolutionary trajectory that leads to resistance. Indeed, our data shows that both genetic and phenotypic diversity among tumor subclones evolves as cancer cells progress to a resistant state. However, it is not yet known the specific phenotypes that promote that resistant state, the interactions among them, and how they converge to common resistant phenotypes seen in late stage cancer.

In spite of the crucial importance of invasive cancer phenotype, we still have only fragmentary knowledge and understanding of the mechanisms leading to transition from proliferative to aggressive, migratory behavior of cancer cells, which we refer to as Proliferative-to-Aggressive phenotype switching.

Instead of focusing on the highly diverse, patient-specific spectrum of mutations that can initiate cancer, CaST is concentrating on the regulatory machinery found within cancer cells that is responsible for tumor homeostasis and tumor canalization. Just as regulatory networks have been shown to enable cells to differentiate during development and maintain stable phenotypes, CaST is testing the hypothesis that similar regulatory principles can be used to understand how cancer cells survive and propagate as tumors grow and respond to treatment. Understanding the regulatory logic behind tumor homeostasis and canalization over the time course of disease is critical for addressing several key challenges facing precision medicine; namely, how malignant tumors evade treatment, induce disease progression, and develop drug resistance.

Metastasis encompasses processes associated with mesenchymal (invasion) and epithelial (proliferation) phenotypes. Epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT) and mesenchymal to epithelial (MET) transitions define subsets of cancer stem cells, which are implicated as critical drivers of metastasis. In particular, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and other disseminated tumor cells commonly exhibit both epithelial and mesenchymal features, suggesting that cancer cells transition between these states. Studies of plasticity in cancer stem cells have focused predominantly on primary tumors, in part due to technological challenges of analyzing cell phenotypes and dynamics in other anatomic sites. To overcome these challenges, we will develop engineered environments for three key sites in tumor progression: primary tumor, intravascular compartment, and bone.

GrantView,CA210190,Center for Modeling Tumor Cell Migration Mechanics,CA210190,"Cell migration is a common feature of high-grade cancer, with invasion and metastasis being primary causes of cancer related death. As a result, our Center will focus on understanding the fundamental mechanics and chemistry of how cells generate forces to move through complex and mechanically challenging tumor microenvironments. The organizing framework of our Center is to then directly target the mechanical machinery and structural elements that drive cell migration. As it is these elements that serve as the most downstream convergence point of the upstream genetic alterations, disruption of these critical elements provides viable, clinically-relevant targets. By focusing directly on the “nuts and bolts” of cell migration, we will be targeting the most vital and non-redundant part of the system. Specifically, we propose integrated modeling and experiments to investigate the molecular mechanics of cell migration and how the tumor microenvironment regulates disease progression as a function of the underlying carcinoma genetics. We will experimentally test our computational cell migration simulator for the mechanical dynamics of cell migration that will ultimately be used to: 1) identify novel drug targets/target combinations in silico, 2) define molecular mechanical subtypes of tumors for patient stratification, 3) guide the engineering of in vitro microsystems and in vivo animal models to better mimic the human disease, and 4) simulate tumor progression under different potential treatment strategies.

It is not possible to predict which patients treated for a primary cancer will develop t-MN, which constitutes a major clinical challenge. A method to assess the risk of translocations after patient exposures to DNA damaging chemotherapy and radiations would inform therapeutic decisions. Translocations depend on the movements of broken DNA ends on non-homologous chromosomes. We developed a method based on diffractive optical elements (DOE) to track photoactivated chromatin reporters and map chromatin motions in the cell nucleus. Our preliminary data show fluctuations in chromatin mobility in response to DNA damage, which may impact on genomic translocations frequencies in cells with DNA damage. The goals for this PS-OP are (1) to develop new methodology to measure chromatin mobility in the 3D nuclear space, (2) to identify the mechanisms controlling chromatin motions after DNA damage and assess their functional consequences for DNA repair efficacy, repair quality, and translocations frequencies, and (3) to test for clinically relevant associations between chromatin motions and genomic translocations using hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell samples from t-MN patients and healthy donors (translational goal).

Tissue-engineered tumors may provide a more powerful system by enabling modular control over key aspects of a tumor and its microenvironment, such as vascular density or interstitial pressure.
This collaborative study seeks to develop and apply new methods of engineering vascularized tumors in vitro, in which the cellular, physical, and genetic composition of the tumor and its microenvironment can be controlled with high spatial and temporal resolution.
The team consists of experts in biomaterials and tissue engineering (Tien, Boston University), quantitative developmental and tumor biology (Nelson, Princeton Unversity), mechanics (Ekinci, Boston University), and clinical tumor biology (Radisky, Mayo Clinic Cancer Center) and pathology (Nassar).
The core enabling technology, which we have been developing over the past fifteen years, is the use of three-dimensional (3D) micropatterned extracellular matrix hydrogels as scaffolds for directing the 3D organization of engineered tissues. Specifically, the proposed work will create microscale human breast tumors that contain perfused capillaries and draining lymphatics, which provide routes for tumor cell escape and enable the capture of those cells for downstream expression profiling. Interstitial stresses and biochemical composition will be analyzed by non-invasive imaging and repeated sampling of interstitial fluid, respectively, to provide longitudinal data for correlation with tumor cell behavior.
This work will also create vascularized collagenous stroma that can accept human breast tumor biopsies as in vitro ""patient-derived xenografts"", for the discovery of candidate mutations that favor tumor invasion and escape; these mutations will then be tested in hypothesis-driven analyses using the engineered breast tumors.

GrantView,CA214297,Metastasis and Biophysics of Clusters of Circulating Tumor Cells in the Microcirculation,CA214297,"Circulating tumor cells drive metastasis when they travel from primary tumors to distant organs via the circulation. Multicellular clusters of circulating tumor cells though less frequently observed in blood, are much more likely to establish metastases than individual circulating tumor cells and the presence of tumor clusters in blood has been associated with dramatically worse prognoses in patients. Although there are many suspected explanations for their greater metastatic potentials, much is still unknown about the behavior of clusters, especially in the narrow vessels of the body. Recent evidence has demonstrated that cluster transiting through narrow constrictions experience dynamic changes to structure and organization. Forces in the microcirculation cause clusters to reversibly re-organize into single-file chains to enable transit through narrow capillary-sized vessels and nuclear envelopes are ruptured and rapidly repaired during migration events through narrow constrictions. Two biophysical parameters within clusters, cellular adhesion strengths and nuclear mechanics, are vital for these behaviors. Because of the important role that these parameters play in many aspects of metastatic progression, we hypothesize that these parameters modulate the biophysical responses of clusters to physical forces in the microcirculation, and that these interactions play a significant role in the competitive edge that clusters have edge over individual cancer cells for seeding metastases. To this end, we propose three specific aims. In aim 1, we will develop next generation models of the human microcirculation with rounded networks of endothelial cell coated microfluidic devices and geometry matched computational simulations. In aim 2, we will explore how intercellular adhesions affect the biophysical responses and metastasis-forming abilities of homogeneous versus heterogeneous clusters in the microcirculation through the use of our developed models. Finally, in aim 3 we will study the physical basis for nuclear envelope rupture, DNA-damage, genetic instability and other DNA-level affects that are involved in metastatic progression.

While early stages of cancer are curable, more than half of the patients who present with disease have locally advanced cancer (lymph nodes) or disease that has spread to other organs (metastatic colon cancer). Sadly, there are few options for patients once the disease has progressed to the metastatic stage. The 5-year survival once a patient has metastatic colon cancer is < 15%.
Managing metastatic colon cancer is a formidable problem for which physicians and scientists have few models with which to dissect the progression from local disease to metastatic disease. To address this gap, we propose to engineer three models to examine key aspects of the microenvironment in both the primary site and metastatic sites.
Our goals are:
1. To integrate stroma into the organotypic models to study the influence of inflammation on cancer cell invasion and migration.
2. To engineer a liver metastasis model using a microfluidic body-on-a-chip platform, so we can study the transformation of cancer cells by the different organ microenvironments.

GrantView,CA214354,Mechanisms of Impaired T-Cell Mechanosensing of Melanoma Antiagents,CA214354,"This project investigates how the tumor microenvironment (TME) impairs in situ interactions of T-cell surface molecules with counter-molecules on the melanoma cells to suppress anti-tumor immunity. Detailed mechanistic understanding will be obtained by an integrated approach that combines physical science (PS) based tools with two complementary pre-clinical mouse models of melanoma T cell immunity, which will be further tested using bio specimens from melanoma patients. The molecular focus is the T-cell receptor (TCR) that initiates the T-cell antigen recognition upon binding to peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC), and the coreceptor CD8 that co-ligates with the pMHC. The first PS tool is single-molecule force techniques for quantifying TCR mechanosensing through in situ kinetic analyses of molecular interactions with concurrent imaging of intracellular signals on a single cell. The second PS tool is DNA-based digital tension probes that report cell generated pulling forces on the TCR and CD8 via engaged pMHC. One animal model is a recognized standard that uses melanoma conjugated with a chicken ovalbumin antigen recognized by the OT-I TCR. The other animal model is a melanoma self-antigen gp100 in conjunction with JR209 humanized transgenic mice. By analyzing the mechanically regulated two-dimensional (2D) ligand binding of TCR and/or CD8 at the T-cell membrane, we observed that the TCR avidities for the pMHC of CD8 T cells infiltrating primary murine melanomas grown in vivo are significantly reduced relative to T cells within non-tumor associated tissues (spleen and blood). Such differential avidities were not detected by the conventional assay using pMHC tetramer, attesting to the power of our mechanics-based methods for analyzing TCR–pMHC interactions. We also found melanomas to substantially alter the force-dependent TCR–pMHC bond durability: in tumor-free animals, the TCR and pMHC formed a catch-slip bond whose lifetime first increased and then decreased with increasing force, which we have previously demonstrated to govern T cell signaling and effector function, whereas in melanoma-bearing animals, the TCR–pMHC bond lifetime only decreased with increasing force, i.e., behaved as a slip bond and were associated with reduced T cell effector functions. We hypothesize that deficient CD8 T cell immunity in melanoma results, at least in part, from impaired antigen recognition within the TME, as manifested by the altered TCR mechanosensing of pMHC. Three specific aims are proposed to test our hypothesis: 1) Determine the molecular interactions crucial to T cell antigen recognition that are impaired by the TME; 2) Define the functional consequences of suppressed T cell antigen recognition; and 3) Elucidate the mechanisms underlying the TME suppression of T cell antigen recognition.

GrantView,CA214369,3D Models of Immunotherapy,CA214369,"Cancer immunotherapy is currently providing exciting new treatment options for patients. However, the majority of patients still do not respond to current immunotherapies, and this failure likely results, at least in part, from an inability to generate potent cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against cancer antigens, and the tolerizing effects of the tumors.
Therapeutic vaccines may be needed to generate robust CTL responses, and we have recently developed a new biomaterials strategy for vaccination that led to unprecedented ability to eradicate established tumors in preclinical models. However, the development of next generation vaccines based on this concept, and therapeutic cancer vaccines more generally, is significantly impaired by the limitations of current model systems available to explore and test these types of therapies.
Preclinical studies typically utilize mouse models, but even humanized mouse models do not capture key aspects of human biology relevant to immunotherapies. Cell culture studies can be used to explore human immune cell biology, but standard human cell culture models do not recreate the 3D, multicellular interactions that direct the immune response against cancer nor the tumor cell-immune cell interactions that dictate vaccination success.
This application proposes to create 3D models of human biology that enable one to study key aspects of vaccination. These models will replicate, in vitro, the vaccine site itself, where the immune response to cancer antigens is initiated, and the tumor, where immune cells encounter cancerous cells, and the function of the immune cells is typically down-regulated by the cells within the tumor.
In order to thoroughly characterize and validate our approach, we will first create 3D mouse models of the vaccine site and the tumor, as this will allow direct comparison between the 3D in vitro model and the in vivo tissue of the same type. These studies will be key to validate the models. We will then create the human models, using tumor, vascular and immune cells all derived from the same patient. These human models will be used to begin exploring several key issues in therapeutic cancer vaccination, including the role of checkpoint blockade and angiogenic factors on the tumors, and the impact of vaccination intratumorally on the immune cell response.
At the completion of this project we will have developed and thoroughly characterized novel, 3D models of both mouse and human biology that will replicate the vaccination site and vascularized tumors.

These systems must recognize that tumor formation and progression involves the co-evolution of cancer cells together with the extracellular matrix, vascular system, immune cells, and supportive cells (e.g. fibroblasts). Thus, a continuous interaction exists between tumor cells and non-tumor cell components through direct cell contact or by the secretion of signaling factors, which is poorly modeled by current systems.We have developed a three-dimensional microfluidic device that contains tumor cell spheroids, which are embedded within an extracellular matrix incorporating endothelial cells, immune cells, growth factors and cytokines. This recapitulates many aspects of the tumor microenvironment, and promotes cancer cell proliferation and migration. We recently found that this system is capable of culturing primary human tumor spheroids from patient derived cancer specimens. Importantly, these spheroids not only contain tumor cells, but also bring with them their unique repertoire of infiltrating immune cells, enabling the capacity to study the phenotypes and function of these immune cell populations, cytokines, and other responses ex vivo.Furthermore, we have demonstrated the ability of this system to measure the specific impact of anti-PD1 or anti-CTLA4 antibodies on immune cell activation, cytokine profiles, and tumor cell killing from patient derived melanoma and thyroid cancer specimens. While evaluation of responses to immunotherapies ex vivo has not been previously tractable, this 3D microfluidic model may be ideally suited for such investigation.

For example, although the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL is widely implicated in resistance to targeted therapies such as those directed against EGFR, its regulation by phosphatidylserine, as opposed to mutation, amplification or autocrine ligand, make identifying the tumors that will respond to AXL-targeted therapy especially challenging.<br><br>We propose to study both downstream and receptor-proximal signaling during bypass resistance mediated by AXL, and then across a wider panel of RTKs.

GrantView,CA215794,An Integrated Systems Approach for Incompletely Penetrant Onco-phenotypes,CA215794,"Perturbation of cancer cells often leads to heterogeneous outcomes, in that most cells exhibit a dominant phenotype, but the rest appear resistant or hypersensitive to the perturbation. If the penetrance of such a phenotype is heritably incomplete, then it becomes extremely difficult to decipher the upstream molecular events that heterogenize the population and cause response variability. By combining quantitative measurements with dynamical models, systems approaches should be useful if provided with a core network of important biomolecules. The daunting hurdle lies in identifying phenotype-relevant regulatory heterogeneities that define the network for penetrance at the single-cell level. Our proposal seeks to exploit a new approach, called stochastic frequency matching (SFM), for elaborating the molecular networks upstream of incompletely penetrant phenotypes. SFM identifies and parameterizes single-cell heterogeneities—which emerge after a uniform perturbation but before the appearance of a variable phenotype—to hone in on regulatory states corresponding to future penetrance. For an onco-phenotype incompletely triggered by ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase signaling in 3D cultured breast epithelia, we implemented SFM using microarrays to uncover a network of critical nucleocytoplasmic regulators. The goals of this proposal are to apply systems approaches to the ErbB nucleocytoplasmic network and adapt SFM more broadly to RNA sequencing of breast cancer patients with ErbB amplification. Based on our provisional SFM results, we hypothesize that ErbB signaling heterogeneously reconfigures the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling state of cells to determine incomplete penetrance of the onco-phenotype. The aims are to: 1) Identify network-level mechanisms for the incompletely penetrant ErbB1:ErbB2 phenotype. 2) Determine whether drivers of incomplete penetrance in 3D define shuttling states in human cancers and promote ErbB2-driven mammary tumors in mice. 3) Sequence and parameterize regulatory-state heterogeneity in HER2+ breast cancers to assemble patient-specific network models of shuttling variability and sensitivity. Drivers of incomplete penetrance are important for understanding transitions during tumor initiation-progression and for developing therapeutic interventions with more reliable patient outcomes.

This concept is most effectively demonstrated by the successes in targeting oncogenic kinases with small molecules or antibody inhibitors. But while successes have garnered significant attention in recent years, precision medicine has not made an impact for the vast majority of cancer patients. The high-profile successes associated with inhibitors of kinases such as ABL, EGFR, ALK, and B-RAF bring to the forefront the major disappointment associated with efforts to establish precision medicine for cancers expressing mutant K-RAS. K-RAS mutations occur in 15% of all cancers, but are significantly enriched in three of the four most deadly forms: lung, colorectal, and pancreatic. Importantly, KRAS mutations are associated with resistance to conventional and targeted therapies, most notably therapies targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor. As such, three decades after the initial identification of KRAS mutations in human cancers, prospective knowledge of K-RAS mutation state in a given cancer is useful largely only for its ability to predict negative response to therapy. The major shortfall of the precision medicine movement is the lack of direct inhibitors for specific oncogenic events, such as K-RAS mutation. The alternative to direct inhibition of an activated oncoprotein is to target downstream pathways, but this requires an absolute understanding of contextual cues that influence oncogenic effector signaling. Lack of depth in our understanding of the relationship between genotype, network signaling state, and therapeutic response leads to ineffective precision medicine. With its focus on network-level biology and its ability to uncover molecular mechanisms through computational analysis, systems biology provides a means to overcome this lack of understanding.

GrantView,CA215848,Model-based Prediction of Redox-Modulated Responses to Cancer Treatments,CA215848,"The goal of our U01 project is to advance precision medicine through consideration of cancer redox metabolism when predicting patient-specific responses to therapies. While the arsenal of approaches to selectively killing cancer cells is increasing, the majority of treatments rely on redox alterations of tumor cells and their microenvironment through chemotherapy, radiation, or some combination thereof. Compared to other cancers, the treatment options available for Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer (HNSCC) patients are particularly limited with only one targeted therapy currently approved by FDA for treatment; therefore, there is a need for new therapeutic strategies and methods to enable systematic/predictive selection of patients for treatment with targeted agents.<br><br>Specifically, we hypothesize that the response to a new class of redox-based chemotherapeutics can be predicted and enhanced by identifying specific metabolic network features contributing to the NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H redox balance and overall levels associated with the specific mechanism of action. We will be investigating the NAD(P)H-driven responses to the quinone-based chemotherapeutics, beta-lapachone (β-Lap) and isobutyl-deoxynyboquinone (IB-DNQ) in laboratory models and clinical specimens of HNSCC. This project will require integration and expansion of our prior successful models of drug bioactivation networks and redox metabolic systems in a comprehensive systems-level approach to improve understanding and enhance prediction of phenotype-specific responses to chemotherapeutic strategies. Development and validation of predictive models of β-Lap or IB-DBQ lethality in HNSCC cell lines will rely upon novel genome-wide metabolomics approaches to identify key enzymatic contributors to NAD(P)H levels required for driving drug metabolism and DNA lesion repair. The predictive capabilities of our computational models will be enhanced by accounting for metabolic diversity across HNSCC tumors and RNAi manipulation of enzyme levels to extract predictive proteomic/metabolic signatures associated with quinone redox cycling. Finally, the model-based predictions of therapeutic outcomes will be tested with HNSCC clinical specimens via ex vivo assays and targeted metabolic profiling. We anticipate that our multi-disciplinary project – relying on a team of investigators in pharmacology, oncology, redox biology, mass spectrometry, and computational modeling – will identify metabolic regulatory features applicable to the treatment of other cancers by molecular or systemic chemotherapies.",U01,"Metabolism, Drug Resistance/Sensitivity","Georgia Institute of Technology, Indiana University, Wake Forest","GTech, IU, Wake Forest","Melissa Kemp, Cristina Furdui, David Boothman, Baran D.

GrantView,CA217297,Systems Analysis of Epigenomic Architecture in Cancer Progression,CA217297,"Despite anti-hormone therapies in patients, the cognate receptors ER_ and AR can remain functional to support oncogenic signaling for advanced progression of breast and prostate cancers. Intensive studies have uncovered cellular and biochemical changes underlying the development of hormone resistance. However, epigenetic mechanisms for establishing and maintaining a hormone-resistant phenotype remain to be explored. Our recent studies have found remarkably similar epigenetic machineries that regulate hormone-independent gene transcription in both breast and prostate cancers. This process has multifaceted components, involving trans- and cis-acting elements, nucleosome reorganization, and chromatin interactions. To understand this complex mechanism, the San Antonio-Duke University Research Center for Cancer Systems Biology (SA-Duke RCCSB) has assembled a team of 21 experimental and computational investigators, and oncologists who plan to study a three-tiered epigenetic framework for gene regulation.<br><br>First, microenvironmental cues initiate the recruitment of a specific combination of trans-bound transcription factors (TFs), called MegaTrans TFs, to ER_ or AR-bound enhancers (Project 1). MegaTrans TFs are composed of diverse signaling-dependent transcription factors that activate these enhancers through receiving other signal cues without hormone stimulation. Second, this hormone-independent action requires well-orchestrated repositioning of nucleosomes, enabling maximal MegaTrans-DNA contact in target chromatin regions (Project 2). Pioneer factor FOXA1 and chromatin remodelers are also critical regulators of repositioned nucleosomes during the transition of a hormone-sensitive to -resistant phenotype. Third, this concerted action triggers chromatin movement, remotely bringing the MegaTrans/enhancer complexes in close proximity to target promoters (Project 3). Intra- and inter-chromatin interactions facilitate the formation of transcriptional architectures that efficiently and autonomously regulate ER_/AR-mediated gene expression even in the absence of agonists or in the presence of antagonists. Experimental investigators plan to use omics-seq platforms to map combinatorial MegaTrans complexes, repositioned nucleosomes, and topologically associated domains (TADs) that spatiotemporally regulate hormone-independent transcription. Computational scientists then use omics data to derive 3D models of DNA-eRNA-protein interacting units in subnuclear compartments of cancer cells. Back to the bench, experimental scientists will use in silico findings to validate enhancer/gene markers that predict a hormone-resistant phenotype in patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and clinical samples. To ensure seamless data integration of the three projects, a Data Analysis and Management Core will implement customized toolkits to manage computational infrastructure and store omics-seq metadata for heuristic queries by community systems biologists.

GrantView,CA217376,Arizona Cancer and Evolution Center,CA217376,"Cancer is an evolutionary and ecological phenomenon driven by the fundamental forces of evolution: mutations, natural selection and genetic drift. It provides a classic example of multi-level selection. At the level of individual cancer cells, selection favors neoplastic proliferation; at the level of the host organism, selection favors cancer suppression. A full understanding of cancer hinges on an appreciation of this fundamental tension. Regulatory mechanisms at the organismal level determine evolutionary parameters at the cell level such as the somatic mutation rate and response to DNA damage. Cancer circumvents those constraints and changes the parameters of cell-level evolution, leading to malignancy and eventual host death. Thus, organismal and cell-level evolution feed back upon each other. To paraphrase Dobzhansky, nothing in cancer biology makes sense except in the light of evolution. This opens an opportunity. We may apply evolutionary and ecological theory to neoplastic progression and response to therapy.<br><br>The mission of the Arizona Cancer and Evolution Center (ACE) is to advance our fundamental understanding of cancer and its clinical management through the development and application of evolutionary and ecological models to cancer biology.

GrantView,CA217377,Quantitative and Functional Characterization of Therapeutic Resistance in Cancer,CA217377,"Despite tremendous advances in understanding of cancer pathogenesis, the treatment of individual patients with either conventional chemotherapy or targeted agents remains highly empiric. Current efforts to predict drug efficacy are generally focused on genetic and transcriptional markers of pathway activation or drug binding, such as resistance mutations that sterically hinder small molecule binding or activate parallel or orthogonal signaling pathways. These markers exist in a very small fraction of all cancers, such that most patients are treated with little or no understanding of whether they will respond to an individual therapy. This results in many patients receiving ineffective and/or unnecessarily toxic therapies. There is a desperate need to change this paradigm. The ideal for characterizing therapeutic sensitivity would allow for: real-time decision making, identification of rare subpopulations with therapeutic resistance, analysis of very small samples (e.g. MRD), and maintenance of viable individual cells for downstream assays to characterize phenotypic, genotypic, transcriptional and other determinants of sensitivity.",U54,"Drug Resistance/Sensitivity, Microenvironment",Massachusetts Institute of Technology,MIT,"Scott Manalis, Douglas A.

Our approaches stem from the idea that cancer cells proliferate and evolve in complex environments that have been highly selected for the robust control of growth and differentiation, and thus the behaviors of cancer cells can only be fully understood in the context of the design principles underlying such control. CaSB@UCI is a joint effort by the systems biology and cancer biology communities at the University of California Irvine (UCI), as represented by two campus-wide research organizations, the Center for Complex Biological Systems and the Cancer Research Institute of the UCI Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center.<br><br>Funding for the center comes from the National Cancer Institute, through the Cancer Systems Biology Centers program.<br><br>The UCI Center for Cancer Systems Biology (CaSB@UCI) is carrying out three coordinated, team-oriented research projects on the role of context, cooperation and community in the initiation and progression of cancer. All three projects seek to understand how the in vivo behaviors of transformed cells are constrained by rules inherited from the communities of diverse, interacting cell types and lineage hierarchies within which those cells arise. Project 1 leverages new observations from xenograft models of colon cancer to investigate non-genetic heterogeneity in solid tumors, both its origins and its relevance to tumor growth and response to therapy. Project 2 investigates the cellular origins of melanoma, seeking to clarify the relationship between melanoma and the benign lesions (melanocytic nevi) that are driven by a common oncogenic event. This work focuses on interactions among melanocyte precursors, within the skin environment, and under conditions that promote progression from benign to malignant. Project 3 focuses on improving models of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and its treatment, taking into account interactions between hierarchical lineages, intercellular feedback, and dynamics.<br><br>All three projects combine mathematical modeling, genomics, and experimental manipulation of animal models. Mathematical modeling is central to all three projects, not just as a means to analyze large data sets, but as a way of identifying, with the most generality, the architectures of cell interaction and feedback that can explain generic features of cancer cell behavior. All three projects develop models with design principles built on similar concepts: cell state transitions, proliferation and quiescence, positive and negative feedback, but in different contexts that derive from the different cancer types (spatial vs. non-spatial; focus on self-organizing pattern vs. focus on control; emphasis on model and parameter identification vs. emphasis on replicating qualitative behaviors). A common theme is the idea that bi- and multistability that arises as a result of feedback can potentially explain bifurcating system behaviors, such as nevi and melanoma in the same mouse, spatial patterns of heterogeneity, or resistance to cancer therapy, without having to attribute such events to new mutational “hits.”<br><br>The three projects are served by a core facility for investigating tumor cells at the single cell level, providing access to the latest in single-cell genomic, transcriptomic and other technologies, which are needed to provide the kind of data that can adequately constrain models.<br><br>An Administrative Core provides the organizational framework and logistic support for the center.

GrantView,CA217450,Phenotype Heterogeneity and Dynamics in SCLC,CA217450,"Our Center addresses a fundamental issue in oncology: the pervasive and ubiquitous occurrence of phenotypic heterogeneity in any cancer, at all stages of progression. The overarching goal of the Center is to produce a quantitative understanding of plasticity and dynamics of cancer cell phenotypes in a tumor, as we believe this knowledge holds the promise of major advances in treatment. Both genetic and epigenetic factors contribute to tumor heterogeneity. Furthermore, multidirectional interactions of distinct tumor cell phenotypes amongst themselves and with host cells shape the evolutionary trajectory of a tumor, including its metastatic properties. Thus, heterogeneity is a complex, multiscale problem (from genes to molecules to cells to tissues), intrinsically unsuitable to reductionist approaches. Rather, we consider a systems-level approach to current challenges, which include: 1) identifying useful quantitative metrics of a tumor phenotypic space; 2) defining deterministic and stochastic components of heterogeneity at molecular and cellular levels; 3) deriving emergent tumor phenotype dynamics from single-cell behavior; and 4) designing effective treatment strategies based on this system-level knowledge.<br><br>To tackle these challenges, we frame tumors as complex adaptive systems and apply concepts from dynamical systems theory. Furthermore, we resolved to focus a multitude of theoretical and experimental approaches on one single cancer type, Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC), which at the moment is a disease with dismal outcomes and no improvement in treatment approaches for over half a century.<br><br>SCLC is an ideal model system to study the impact of phenotypic heterogeneity on progression and treatment resistance. Virtually all tumors exhibit degrees of plasticity, but SCLC is on the extreme side, facilitating data interpretation and possibly reducing the influence of confounding factors. For instance, SCLC tumors exhibits rapid relapse after initial high levels of response to chemoradiation treatment. Relapse is not associated with recurrent acquired resistance mutations, pointing to a major role for phenotypic state transitions. SCLC initiation and promotion involve obligatory biallelic inactivation of tumor suppressors p53 and Rb, while driver oncogenes appear to be absent. Nonetheless, diverse intra-tumor SCLC cellular phenotypes emerge in patients and mouse model tumors, supporting the idea that SCLC aggressiveness and treatment escape depend of phenotype diversity. Our working hypothesis is that heterogeneous phenotypes and their interaction dynamics form a robust SCLC tumor ecosystem adaptable to perturbations and treatment. In our Center, the overarching goal is to test this hypothesis with a combination of experimental and modeling approaches and if correct, at least in part, demonstrate its general value for other cancer types.",U54,"Heterogeneity, Drug Resistance/Sensitivity, Microenvironment",Vanderbilt University,Vanderbilt,Vito Quaranta,CSBC,4/13/18,3/31/24,https://reporter.nih.gov/search/7oEeIDe9Dk6U73ku1dSlqQ/projects,5,,https://www.synapse.org/#!Team:3471071,https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn18435914,d88901ea-7317-4432-9fba-d03ea012f0fc,syn53259587

Nine of ten kidney cancers are renal cell carcinoma (RCC). To reduce mortality from RCC, improvements are needed at all stages, from diagnosis to prognosis to therapy. In response to the funding opportunity “Biological Comparisons in Patient-derived Models of Cancer (U01)”, we will compare four types of patient-derived models of RCC to investigate the relative authenticity of each as a preclinical model. The first will be patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), widely perceived as the most representative models of human pathophysiology. These have been previously established from a range of pathologic and clinical stages of RCC. The PDXs will serve as the “gold standard” to which to compare three PDX-derived models, including tissue slice cultures (TSCs), primary cell cultures, and xenografts generated from cell cultures. The biological comparison on which we focus is metabolism. Dysregulated metabolism, one of the hallmarks of cancer, is strongly implicated in the development and progression of RCC. Pleiotropic changes include dysregulation of oxygen sensing, energy sensing and nutrient sensing. In particular, high frequency mutations in VHL and FBP1 genes contribute to exhibition of the “Warburg effect” (an elevation of glycolysis in the presence of oxygen) in clear cell RCC, the major subtype of RCC, leading to increased production and excretion of lactate. Comparing metabolism among the four patient-derived models of RCC will capture the functional consequences of genetic, transcriptomic, environmental and other influences to provide a comprehensive picture of the phenotype of each model system. We will use hyperpolarized (HP) 13C magnetic resonance (MR), a remarkably sensitive molecular imaging technique, to surveil dynamic pathway-specific metabolic and physiologic processes in the patient-derived RCC models, yielding biologically and clinically relevant data. Aim 1 will identify the metabolic signature of each of 8 RCC PDXs by HP MR imaging and steady state metabolomic profiling. The metabolic data will be associated with genotypic, transcriptomic and immunotypic features to establish the phenotype of each PDX. In Aim 2, thin precision-cut tissue slices will be prepared from each of the 8 PDXs and placed in a NMR-compatible, 3D tissue culture bioreactor. The metabolic phenotype of the TSCs will be determined by HP MR and steady state studies and compared to that of the original PDXs, along with genetic, transcriptomic and immunohistologic features.

However, there have been no systematic studies that compare the PDMCs to understand whether different PDMC growth environments can cause distinct phenotypic and molecular changes to patient- derived cancer cells carrying the same genetic mutations This proposal aims to test an overarching hypothesis that patient-derived cancer cells can undergo distinct epigenetic reprogramming in response to the different PDMC environments, which impact tumor phenotypes such as heterogeneity, chemoresistance, metastasis, and immune adaptation. By assembling a multidisciplinary team consisting of clinicians, geneticists, and engineers, this project will systematically profile the epigenomes of three PDMC colorectal cancer (CRC) models: organoid, patient- derived xenograft (PDX), and humanized immunoproficient PDX. The evolution of the tumor cell epigenetic landscape in PDMC (and vs. original patient tumors) and in response to therapy will be investigated. Whether P matched primary and metastatic CRCs from the same patient remain epigenetically distinct or converge will also be tested. A novel precision CRISPR-based epigenomic editing screening technology will then identify specific epigenetic drivers that contribute to PDMC tumor growth and chemoresistance. If successful, this comprehensive study will systematically characterize the differences between these PDMCs, which will be informative for future basic and translational studies. Furthermore, this study will provide insights into epigenetic regulation of CRC chemoresistance, metastasis, and immune evasion. These insights are important thanks to emerging evidence suggesting that genetic mutation alone cannot account for all phenotypic changes across PDMCs.

GrantView,CA217613,Matching panels of in vivo and in vitro model system of pediatric brain tumors,CA217613,"Brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. Poor understanding of the interactions between tumor cells, especially cancer stem cells (CSCs), and normal brain tissues have played a role. Due to the difficulties of obtaining tumor tissues, there is a limited availability of biologically accurate and matched in vitro (tumor organoid) and in vivo (PDOX) model systems. Normal brain tissue is more difficult to obtain, making it nearly impossible to develop normal brain organoids. To overcome these barriers, we propose to utilize our existing (n=127) and future established patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models as the source supply of tumor cells to develop matching tumor organoids. These PDOX models replicate the biology of original patient tumors and represent a wide spectrum of the newly discovered molecular subtypes of malignant brain tumors. Using 24 PDOX models, we have established 13 (54.1%) tumor organoids. Recognizing the rarity of normal brain tissues, we propose to use autopsied tissues. Indeed, we have cryopreserved viable cells of normal cerebrum, cerebellum, brain stem, and sub-ventricular zone cells from children of different ages and showed that the autopsied cerebral cells can proliferate in vitro to form neurospheres. We, therefore, hypothesize that 1) autopsied normal brain tissues and PDOX models can provide critically needed and biologically accurate cells for the development of normal and tumor organoid, and 2) the growth of these organoid are dependent on the growth factor milieu of their location and modulated by the dynamic interactions between different types of cells. Radiation therapy is one of the most important treatment regimens for pediatric brain tumors. Since mutation of histone modification genes are frequent in pediatric brain tumors, our 3rd hypothesis is that such epigenetic changes affect responses and resistance toward radiation, and successful targeting in organoid and PDOX tumors will lead to new combination therapies. We propose three Specific Aims. Aim 1: Develop normal brain organoids from autopsied normal cerebrum, cerebellum, brain stem and subventricle zone from all age groups and establish tumoral organoids from PDOX models and identify their location- and developmental-stage dependent niche factor combinations, respectively. Aim 2: Understand the dynamic interactions between tumor (CSCs and non-stem tumor) cells and normal brain cells. We will use co-culture assays to identify the niche factor combinations that dictate cellular diversity and survival of CSC and normal brain cells, and perform global multi-omics analysis and single cell RNAseq to elucidate the molecular mechanisms, followed by in vivo validation of our findings in PDOX models. Aim 3: Determine the role of histone methylation in regulating CSC survival and self-renewal of malignant brain tumors when perturbed by radiation. We will use normal and tumoral organoids to determine how pre-existing histone methylation status affect their survival and to identify key radiation-resistant methylation(s) by combining radiation with an informer set of small-molecule probes that selectively target distinct nodes in tumor epigenetic regulatory circuity in organoids and in PDOX models.",U01,"Epigenetics, Experimental Model Development",Lurie Children's Hospital,Lurie Children's Hospital,Xiao-Nan Li,PDMC,3/3/20,2/28/25,https://reporter.nih.gov/search/nEb0SAOktkKmB4ji9k17Ow/projects,4,,https://www.synapse.org/#!Team:3471165,https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn35270560,b26f4194-ed6c-4bdc-961e-86ef65a93485,syn53259587

The models will be derived from patient samples acquired at 2-3 longitudinal time points during the patients’ cancer treatments. To our knowledge, this will be the first effort to establish a triad of patient-derived models of cancer (PDMCs) in longitudinal series from breast cancer patients undergoing standard clinical care. Importantly, the models will be associated with annotated clinical data on patient treatment and outcomes. PDMCs will be functionally evaluated for their response to patient-matched therapies.

Aim 2 will investigate whether PDMCs appropriately model patient response to therapy – an assessment that is needed to determine their potential application in basic research, drug discovery, and as predictors of optimal therapies for patients undergoing treatment. PDMCs will be evaluated in a co-clinical study to test the concordance of response between PDMCs and the clinical response observed in patients. We will also evaluate the concordance of PDOs and PDMCs against a panel of FDA-approved cancer therapies, genomic-guided therapies, and investigate whether the chemo-sensitivity of clones in PDOs and PDCRCs is associated with their observed clonal frequency in patient tumors following treatment.

GrantView,CA217655,Steady States and Cellular Transitions Associated with Carcinogenesis and Tumor Progression,CA217655,"Cellular transitions between two distinct states are fundamental to many steps of carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Such transitions are broadly studied, but general models have been historically limited to qualitative descriptions. This contrasts with phase transitions in physical systems, such as the transition between ferro- and paramagnetic states, which are well characterized within the context of the physico-chemical laws, and can be partially understood, in a predictive capacity, using simple, precise models such as the Ising model. Such models are based upon a system of interacting lattice sites. A parameter (e.g. temperature) is varied, and the fluctuations of the lattice sites are analyzed as the system approaches and passes through a critical point. These models are largely independent of many details of the specific system under study; the critical system-specific details are captured in the interactions between the lattice sites. Nevertheless, they can yield specific predictions that can, in principle, be experimentally verified, such as increased fluctuations in the vicinity of the critical point, and the loss of one or more degrees of freedom at the critical point. Ising-like in silico models have guided theoretical studies of transitions in various gene or protein regulatory networks, although resultant predictions can be challenging to experimentally test.<br><br>We seek a potentially general approach where the experimental input is a statistically large number of single cell measurements, with many analytes quantitatively measured from each cell. From this data we capture the fluctuations and thereby determine the correlations of many analytes. In an Ising model analogy, such measurements define the site interactions. These inputs permit straightforward theoretic models for resolving cellular steady states, transitions between steady states, and for making testable predictions. Studies of the chemically-induced-carcinogenesis transition are provided as preliminary data/proof of concept. For Aim 1, we develop a picture of cancer cell steady states using integrated metabolic and proteomic single cell assays.

GrantView,CA220378,Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma,CA220378,"Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits profound intratumoral molecular heterogeneity that contributes to treatment resistance and poor survival. Specifically, each tumor comprises multiple molecularly-distinct subpopulations with different treatment sensitivities. This heterogeneity not only portends the pre-existence of resistant molecular subpopulations, but also the communications between neighboring subpopulations that further modulate tumorigenicity and resistance. In fact, a minority tumor subpopulation with EGFRvIII mutation has been shown to potentiate a majority subpopulation with wild-type EGFR to increase tumor growth, cell survival, and drug resistance. This type of cooperativity presents clear implications for improving GBM treatment. Yet compared to other tumor types, the interactions in GBM remain critically understudied.<br><br>A significant barrier to studying the interactions between molecularly-distinct subpopulations is the challenge of tissue sampling in GBM. In particular, contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) routinely guides surgical biopsy and resection of the MRI enhancing core, but fails to address the diverse subpopulations of the surrounding non-enhancing parenchyma (so called “brain around tumor” or BAT). These unresected residual subpopulations in BAT represent the main contributors to tumor recurrence, which can exhibit different therapeutic targets (and interactions) compared with enhancing biopsies. To address the limitations of tissue sampling, imaging techniques can help quantitatively characterize tumors in their entirety, including unresected BAT regions. Our group has used multi-parametric MRI and image-guided biopsies to develop and validate machine-learning (ML) models of intratumoral genomic heterogeneity, with particular focus on the BAT zone.<br><br>In Aim 1, will we collect and molecularly profile a large set of image-recorded stereotactic biopsies in primary GBM patients to quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations, as well as their phenotypic niches, throughout the BAT zone. We will assess local heterogeneity at the biopsy level and also co-localize regional patterns and rates of recurrence on serial MRI. In Aim 2, we will use these biopsies and spatially matched MRI metrics to refine our existing ML predictive models. We will use these ML models to co-localize spatial patterns of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their phenotypic niches) to quantify their risk of regional recurrence. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate the subpopulation interactions observed in Aims 1 and 2 using patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We will also validate these interactions in human GBM using a subset of spatially matched biopsies from primary and recurrent tumors in the same patients.<br><br>This proposal leverages our unique expertise in image-guided tissue analysis and MRI-based computational modeling to study the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations and the evolving competitive landscapes in human GBM.

GrantView,CA223976,Biological Comparisons Among Three Derivative Models of Glioma Patient Cancers Under Microenvironmental Stress,CA223976,"Current methods of preclinical testing of potential therapeutics have been, for the most part, underwhelming in terms of their ability to yield a clinical impact. This is particularly true for glioblastoma (GBM) where prognosis has increased only by 2-3 months over the last 75 years with a 5-year survival of less than 4%. Many promising preclinical studies have failed to live up to expectations when tested clinically. This problem is likely due to: a) limitations of the preclinical model system and b) lack of reliable biomarkers for proper patient selection. To address these issues, investigators are increasingly utilizing patient-­derived models of cancer (PDMC) coupled with comprehensive molecular profiling. However, differences in model composition, growth conditions, and other microenvironmental factors limit reliability of these models and hamper interpretation. We believe that a careful investigation of tumor microenvironmental (TME) stressors on 3 patient­derived models (xenolines) of GBM, namely xenografts (PDX), spheroid cultures (neurospheres), and human biomatrix embedded 3D microtumors, will provide insight into critical aspects of tumor biology that are influenced by model and TME. These models pre­ and post­ TME perturbagen will also be comprehensively profiled at the genomic, transcriptomic, and kinomic (global kinase activity assessment through a peptide substrate microarray) level to generate a similarity distance metric. We hypothesize that application of TME stressors to the PDMC’s will improve both molecular and biological fidelity of the respective models to that of the original tumor or parent xenoline that can be visualized and in silico tested using an advanced computational data modeling system (GeneTerrain). Our preliminary data generated from prior NIH funded projects indicate that our existing xenolines recapitulate all four molecular subtypes of GBM identified in The Cancer Genome Atlas while reproducing the key hallmarks of GBM when implanted orthotopically in immunocompromised mice. Importantly, we can grow disaggregated xenoline tumors in a novel three-dimensional (3D) culture system incorporating many cells of the tumor microenvironment to produce 3D microtumors suitable for higher throughput drug testing. Moreover, we have preliminary evidence that TME manipulation of BTICs or 3D microtumors (e.g., hypoxia or nutrient deprivation) promotes a more aggressive tumor phenotype in vitro and in vivo that is accompanied by changes in kinomic signatures. Therefore, we will: 1) Generate 3 PDMC models from existing xenolines as well as de novo GBM patient tumors with comprehensive omic testing to calculate similarity distance metrics among the models with corresponding biological assessments including growth, chemoradiation sensitivity, and stemness markers;; 2) Perform TME perturbagen testing of the derivative PDMCs (neurospheres and 3D microtumors) and determine impact on tumor biology and similarity distance metric;; 3) Develop and validate GeneTerrain models of the various PDMCs with respect to TME and therapeutic sensitivity (radiation and temozolomide).",U01,"Microenvironment, Experimental Model Development",University of Alabama at Birmingham,UAB,"Christopher D.

Somatic alterations of four driver genes (KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4) are common among many cases of PDA; however, PDA can be phenotypically categorized into multiple neoplastic subtypes, each with myriad types of stroma and anti-tumor immunity. Only incremental clinical advances have been made in the treatment of PDA, potentially due to the paucity of well-annotated and validated patient-derived models of pancreatic cancer available to the research community. As a first step to translating the use of patient-derived models of cancer (PDMCs), we must identify the strengths and limitations of each type of PDMC, including whether PDMCs mirror genetic and biologic characteristics of the human, parent tumor. Herein, we propose a multi-institutional project designed to extend our existing library of PDA PDMCs and depict which model(s) best represent specific aspects of their parent tumors. PDMCs that capture an inter-tumor heterogeneity and can maintain pro-oncogenic regulatory pathways are critically needed to better enhance current therapies and identify novel therapeutic strategies. We are currently collecting PDA specimens and generating conditionally re-programmed cells (CRC), organoids (ORG), and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) through the Oregon Pancreas Tissue Registry and from a targeted therapy (i.e., PARP inhibitor-based) clinical trial. The PDMCs generated have well-annotated clinical outcomes and drug response data. Here, we will systematically and thoroughly profile matched PDMCs to determine the significance of key molecular networks (including KRAS, MYC, DDR, HuR, and inflammation) and phenotypic subpopulations that best match their respective tumors from patients. We will also build more complex PDMCs by adding elements of the parent tumor microenvironment that can restore phenotypes absent in simple PDMCs. Complementary drug sensitivity studies will be tested in both simple and complex PDMCs as another metric of their relatedness to the parent tumor and patient responses. To perform this work, we have assembled a multi- disciplinary team with expertise in clinical oncology, specimen collection/processing, pathology, cancer model generation, tumor microenvironment, computational biology, RNA biology, DNA repair, and database management. Work will be performed in three specific aims: Aim 1, generate and validate PDMCs; determine if key PDA signaling pathways are conserved with the matched parent tumor; Aim 2, identify PDMCs from clinically tracked specimens that best predict drug responses in patients; identify and target key pathways of resistance; Aim 3: identify signaling pathways and drug responses that are lost in simple PDMCs but that can be restored by adding known elements of the parent tumor (e.g., stromal mesenchymal, endothelial and immune cells).

These grim statistics owe, in part, to the profound resistance of PDA to current therapies. More effective treatment strategies would offer tremendous benefit to PDA patients. Emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic and genetic heterogeneity exist in both the neoplastic and non-neoplastic compartments of pancreatic tumors, and that this heterogeneity may impact response to treatment. Our own studies have identified two subpopulations of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) present within the PDA microenvironment, a cancer-proximal population that expresses myofibroblast markers and a cancer-distal population that expresses inflammatory markers such as the cytokine IL-6. However, the full complement of cell populations present within the PDA tumors and the mechanisms through which each population might impact tumor biology remain unclear. Tackling these questions requires models that accurately recapitulate human PDA. Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), organoid cultures, organoid-stromal co-cultures, and organoid xenografts have emerged as “next-generation” models that better mimic the complex interactions present in the PDA microenvironment. Yet, the extent to which each model preserves the diverse populations found in human tumors remains unclear. To address this question, we propose to generate a series of matching organoid and xenograft models which we will use to characterize and perturb subpopulations of neoplastic cells and CAFs. We will generate and characterize five sets of paired organoid culture and PDX models, where pairs are derived the same de-identified patient tumor specimens. In addition, we will develop a new model for pancreatic cancer in which patient-derived PDA organoids are delivered to mice in situ via injection into the main pancreatic duct, better recapitulating the developmental trajectory of human PDA than other xenograft approaches. We will use single-cell RNA and DNA sequencing as well as barcoded organoid lines to characterize and perturb the neoplastic and CAF populations present in our models. To study to role of IL-6 in PDA more directly, we will use biochemical and genetic strategies to perturb CAF-mediated IL-6 signalling in our models. Among these, we will make use of a murine model engineered to express human IL-6 as a host for our PDA xenografts, restoring the ability for IL-6 generated in the stroma to signal to the transplanted neoplastic cells. Ultimately, our studies will shed light on the distinct subpopulations of neoplastic cells and CAFs present in the PDA microenvironment and help to identify which of those subpopulations function to promote the aggressive traits characteristic of PDA tumors. The knowledge gained from our studies will provide valuable insights into the nature of the tumor microenvironment.

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of PCa progression has been hampered by a lack of clinically relevant PCa models. Recently, patient-derived models of cancer (PDMCs; e.g., patient-derived xenografts [PDXs] and organoids) have been used to develop therapeutically relevant approaches. We hypothesize that longitudinal studies of tumor specimens (and corresponding PDMCs) obtained over time from the same patient will lead to a better understanding of the diverse dominant pathways that drive metastatic progression. We also hypothesize that organoids will complement PDXs as part of an integrated analysis of human tissue and derived PDMCs (obtained at single time points) to understand the mechanisms of response and resistance to target pathways commonly activated in CRPC. We will test these hypotheses through the following specific aims: Aim 1. Analyze human donor tumors and corresponding PDMCs to identify dominant molecular alterations that drive PCa progression and select models to study. We will develop PDMCs from clinically annotated tumor specimens derived from men with potentially lethal PCa, including PDMCs derived from tumor specimens obtained at different times during progression (longitudinal studies) and from different areas of the same tumor. We will assess human PCa specimens and PDMCs’ morphology and expression of genes associated with PCa progression and subject them to whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing. PCa specimens and PDMCs derived from the longitudinal studies will also be subjected to whole-genome sequencing and epigenomic analysis. Finally, we will develop a publicly available interactive database linking molecular and preclinical results of PDMC characterization with clinical and molecular details of donor human PCa. These studies' findings will serve as the basis for the identification and prioritization of aberrant molecular pathways for further study. This knowledge is also essential to understanding how each PDMC provides information about the alterations in human donor tumor. Aim 2. Study genomic alterations acquired in metastasis specimens in the longitudinal studies for their potential to confer metastatic ability to cells. We will genetically modify organoids to create the genomic alterations found in the metastases. We will subsequently study how the genetic modification of these genes influences specific steps involved in metastasis, namely invasion, migration, and ability to grow at distant sites. Aim 3. Utilize PDMCs to study mechanisms of PCa response/resistance to targeted therapies on pathways implicated in PCa progression. We will seek a mechanistic understanding of PCa response and/or resistance to therapies in clinical trials targeting the AR, DNA damage response, Wnt-canonical, and PI3K pathways.

GrantView,CA225566,Nuclear Dysfunction in Cancer: The Role of Mechanical Stresses Transmitted by the LINC Complex,CA225566,"The nuclear lamina is physically connected through nuclear envelope proteins to the cytoskeleton by the LINC complex (linker of nucleoskeleton to cytoskeleton), which spans the nuclear envelope and allows the transmission of mechanical forces to the nucleus. LINC complex proteins are frequently mutated or dysregulated in cancer, and some of these mutations have been proposed to be cancer drivers. Yet, how alterations to the LINC complex might promote cancer development is not known. Our overarching hypothesis is that cytoskeletal force transmission to the nucleus is altered in cancer due to driver mutations in LINC proteins contributing to loss of epithelial polarity, aberrant tissue structure, abnormal gene expression, transformation and invasive cancer cell migration. The cancer nucleus remains highly understudied, with much to learn known about the physical principles that govern nuclear positioning, dysmorphia and chromatin organization, and how altered nuclear stresses contribute to cancer cell dysfunction. This necessarily requires an integrated understanding of both molecular and physical mechanisms. Extensive expertise gained in other systems will be coupled with new approaches for measuring forces on the nucleus.

GrantView,CA227136,Modeling and Druggable-Genome Screening of Glioblastoma Invasion Using Regional Biopsy-Guided Biomaterials Systems,CA227136,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating brain tumor lacking effective treatments. This is largely due to invasion of GBM cells, which enables escape from resection and drives inevitable recurrence, typically 2 cm from the location at diagnosis. Progress in developing therapies to combat this process has been slow due to problems with the cells being studied and the methods of analysis.First, existing studies have failed to recognize that infiltrating GBM cells extending beyond the tumor edge have evolved a unique adaptive cellular machinery due to local stressors in their microenvironment. Unfortunately, these cells at the invasive tumor front are often not the ones sampled in studies analyzing banked tumor tissue, which is typically procured from the readily accessible central portions of the tumor.Another problem is that most studies of invasiveness have used two-dimensional (2D) culture systems coated with a thin layer of ECM proteins, which fail to capture the dimensionality, mechanics, and heterogeneity of GBM invasion. To address these limitations, our team has combined site-directed biopsies from GBM with tissue engineered platforms to study invasion in vitro. Using site-directed biopsies, we have shown increased GBM cell invasiveness and increased expression of invasion-promoting integrins and extracellular matrix (ECM) splice variants outside versus inside enhancing MRI regions. We have also developed patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) from these site-directed biopsies that exhibit more invasiveness when arising from the tumor edge.Our team also became among the first to bioengineer 3D hydrogel systems as a discovery platform In GBM. We found that as CD44-mediated peritumoral invasion falls, perivascular integrin-based motility increases. Here, we will build upon these intriguing discoveries by investigating our central hypothesis that as GBM cells exit the tumor core, reciprocal interactions with the microenvironment drive a targetable transition from peritumoral to perivascular invasion.These goals will be accomplished through three aims: Aim 1 – Define changes in the tumor microenvironment promoting invasive change as tumor cells egress away from the central core to the outer edge of GBM; Aim 2 - Refine bioengineered culture models to replicate the microenvironment of the outer edge of GBM and identify the role of TAMs in driving invasion in this region; and Aim 3 - Define the role of integrins in the invasiveness of GBM cells from the outer tumor edge and identify druggable mediators of invasion in this region.To accomplish these goals, we will use novel PDXs and tissue engineered platforms, along with CRISPRi, single-cell technology, and site-directed biopsies. Our studies will uncover mechanisms by which tumor cells and their microenvironment are altered to drive increased invasiveness as cells migrate away from the tumor core. This work will challenge conventional thinking by showing how GBM integrates distinct regional microenvironments.

GrantView,CA227544,Reverse Sensitivity Analysis for Identifying Predictive Proteomics Signatures of Cancer,CA227544,"Cancer is a complex disease in which genetic disruptions in cell signaling networks are known to play a significant role. A major aim of cancer systems biology is to build models that can predict the impact of these genetic disruptions to guide therapeutic interventions (i.e. personalized medicine). A prominent driver of cancer cell growth is signaling pathway deregulation from mutations in key regulatory nodes and loss/gain in gene copy number (CNV). However, current mathematical modeling approaches do not adequately capture the impact of these genetic changes. Reasons for this include the poorly understood layers of regulation between gene expression and protein activity, and limitations in most modeling and protein measurement technologies. In addition, there is a paucity of overarching hypotheses that can link specific gene expression or mutation patterns to the cancer phenotype. Recent work by our group has resolved some of the technical challenges that have hindered the application of proteomics technologies to cancer systems biology research. It has also suggested a new approach for using quantitative proteomics data to understand mechanisms driving cancer cell behavior. Using an ultrasensitive, targeted proteomics platform that can measure both abundance and phosphorylation of proteins present at only hundreds of copies per cell, we found that signaling pathways appeared to be controlled by only a limited number of key nodes whose activity is tightly regulated through low abundance and feedback phosphorylation. We propose to build on these findings by critically testing the hypothesis that CNV and genetic mutations dysregulate signaling pathways in cancer by shifting control from tightly regulated nodes to poorly regulated ones. This will be done by systematically identifying key regulatory nodes of normal and cancer cells using CRISPRa/i screens, determine the relationship between protein abundance and signaling pathway activities using ultrasensitive targeted proteomics and phosphoproteomics and then use these data to semi-automatically generate mathematical models of the functional topology of the signaling pathways. Specifically, we propose to: 1) Use targeted CRISPR gene perturbation libraries to identify the regulatory topologies of signaling pathways important in cancer and how they are disrupted by common cancer mutations, 2) Use the CRISPR perturbation and proteomics data to semi-automatically build predictive models of cancer cell signaling pathways, and 3) Combine modeling and perturbation screens to understand how feedback regulation in cancer contributes to drug resistance. This work will result in simplified, computationally tractable yet mechanistic models of signaling pathways and provide network maps of feedback and crosstalk circuits that can be used to rapidly map the regulatory state of cells. Most important, it will provide a generic platform for translating protein abundance and phosphorylation patterns into a “state” snapshot of cancers that can lead to predicting their response to specific drugs.",U01,"Drug Resistance/Sensitivity, Heterogeneity",Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,PNNL,"Wei-Jun Qian, Herbert M.

GrantView,CA227550,A plasticity and reprogramming paradigm for therapy resistance at the single cell level,CA227550,"Targeted therapies in melanoma have shown enormous promise in the sense that they can show dramatic reductions in tumor burden, with melanoma being a particularly stark example. However, this promise has failed to be fully realized because of the emergence of resistant tumor cells, which repopulate the tumor and are subsequently difficult or impossible to treat effectively. Typically, scientists have thought of therapy resistance as having genetic origins, with rare mutant tumor cells surviving therapy because of a mutation that causes resistance. Recent work from our labs using advanced single cell analysis, however, suggest that, at the point of attack, there may be other, complementary, non-genetic mechanisms that could also govern exactly why some rare cells are able to evade the effects of the therapy. Subsequently, the targeted therapy itself can reprogram these rare cells into a stably resistant population. This more nuanced """"plasticity and reprogramming"""" view of resistance at the single cell level has opened the possibility of a far richer set of targets that can be exploited for forestalling therapy resistance; however, the current set of tools and models, both experimental and computational, for identifying these targets are underdeveloped and the origin of these biological processes remain mysterious. Here, we propose to develop and apply new concepts and methods in experimental and computational single cell biology to tackle the problem of non-genetic therapy resistance, translating our basic science results towards the clinic through the use of sophisticated in vivo models of melanoma. Our goal is to identify and validate the pathways that govern cellular plasticity in melanoma, develop computational tools to identify the gene networks that drive the formation of cellular plasticity, and ultimately test these interactions in in vivo mouse models. In conjunction, we are developing tools for also specifically targeting the reprogramming phase of resistance, ultimately using all these data collectively to inform models of dosing regiments that we can test in in vivo systems.

GrantView,CA228608,The Metabolic Regulation of Melanoma Metastasis,CA228608,"Most cancer deaths are caused by distant metastasis. Yet the mechanisms that regulate distant metastasis are poorly understood. Metastasis is a very inefficient process in which few disseminated cancer cells survive, and even fewer proliferate, but it is not known why. We developed a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) assay in which melanomas engraft very efficiently and spontaneously metastasize. Using this assay, we discovered intrinsic differences in metastatic potential among melanomas from different patients. Some stage III melanomas are “efficient metastasizers” that spontaneously form distant metastases in patients and in NSG mice while others are “inefficient metastasizers” that do not form distant macrometastases in patients or in NSG mice under the same experimental conditions. Using this assay, we discovered that melanoma cells experience a spike in reactive oxygen species (ROS) during metastasis and that distant metastasis is limited by oxidative stress. Successfully metastasizing cells undergo reversible metabolic changes during metastasis that increase their capacity to withstand oxidative stress, including increased folate pathway dependence. However, the mechanisms that confer differences in metastatic potential upon melanomas from different patients have not yet been identified. We hypothesize that efficiently and inefficiently metastasizing melanomas have intrinsic metabolic differences that reduce oxidative stress in efficient metastasizers. One impediment to testing this hypothesis is that melanomas from patients grow poorly at clonal density in known culture conditions, preventing certain approaches for studying cancer metabolism and the use of CRISPR gene editing (because single cell-derived clones could not be screened or expanded). We spent years developing a culture medium in which single melanoma cells from patients form tumor organoids (PDOs). This capability raises the general question of whether metabolism and oxidative stress resistance are regulated similarly in PDXs and in PDOs. To address this question, we will compare, side-by-side, the biological properties and metabolic regulation of efficient and inefficient metastasizers in PDXs and PDOs. We will test if efficiently metastasizing melanomas have lower ROS levels or markers of oxidative stress, or increased use of the folate or pentose phosphate pathways, as compared to inefficient metastasizers, and whether this promotes metastasis in PDXs or migration/invasion in PDOs. We will also test if MCT1, a lactate transporter, promotes metastasis and whether efficient metastasizers reduce oxidative stress partly through lactate exchange. Finally, we will test if there are intrinsic differences in mitochondrial function between efficient and inefficient metastasizers that reduce ROS generation. By comparing the biological properties and metabolic regulation of each melanoma in PDX and PDO assays, we will assess the strengths and weaknesses of PDX and PDO assays for studying cancer metabolism and biological differences among patients. These results have the potential to identify new mechanisms that regulate metastasis, new aspects of cancer metabolism, and strategies to block progression.",U01,"Metastasis, Method/Assay Development",University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,UT Southwestern,Sean J.

GrantView,CA228963,A Statistical Physics Framework for Understanding the Role of Repeat RNA in Tumor Immunity,CA228963,"Transcriptional dysregulation in tumors can induce the abundant expression of repetitive elements in cancerous cells compared to normal tissues, where they are often transcriptionally silent. Such transcripts have been associated with better outcomes to cancer immunotherapies, as they can modulate the tumor immune microenvironment and generate an under-quantified source of tumor neoantigens. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that the aberrant transcription of repeat RNA is both a critical mechanism for initiating the immune response in the tumor microenvironment and an untapped source of potential therapeutic targets. Using a set of approaches from statistical physics, our team predicted repetitive element RNA directly stimulates receptors of the innate immune system, confirmed this hypothesis in a key subset of immune cells, and showed repeat expression can correlate with response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapies. Repeat RNA is therefore both a novel biomarker for the innate immune response in cancer and a potential therapeutic target to modulate tumor immunity. We will utilize a set of tools, developed by our team, from statistical physics to characterize repeat RNA recognition by innate immune receptors in silico and their role in tumor-immune co-evolution, both with and without the application of immunotherapy (Aim 1). Next, we will characterize the spatial context of repeat RNAs in the tumor immune microenvironment and the co-localization of predicted immunostimulatory RNA with activation of immune signaling, along with in depth immune-phenotyping of the state of the immune microenvironment in vivo (Aim 2). Finally, we will perform functional validation of our predictions on human immune cells to validate mechanisms of recognition and the specific immune subsets responsible for repeat recognition via a set of in vitro assays (Aim 3). Our goal is to use approaches from statistical physics to quantify the role of repetitive elements in tumor immunology, their rules of recognition by innate immune receptors and their part in facilitating cytolytic T cell activity. In doing so we will combine novel RNA detection technologies to study their spatial distribution and localization in cancers; state of the art immune-phenotyping; and mathematical models to characterize their direct role in tumor evolution.

GrantView,CA231978,Systems analysis of aggressive prostate cancer pathology,CA231978,"Tissue pathology is a manifestation of the genomic aberrations that define cancer (i.e. stage, grade, type). In prostate cancer, the best prognostic marker is Gleason score, the composite tumor grading system that summarizes primary tumor morphology. Subsets of patients with localized disease inevitably develop metastases, a point where it is often too late for curative treatment. Thus, we propose to model and therapeutically target molecular subtypes that drive aggressive primary prostate cancer. We start from large, –omic datasets and use tissue pathology and gene expression as the readout of disease development. To evaluate the direct effect of molecular drivers of aggressive primary disease, we use a novel prostate stem cell, tissue recombination mouse model that recapitulates prostate development and tissue pathology. To model specific molecular subtypes, we will genetically engineer mouse prostate stem cells to introduce gene knockouts or Tet-regulated genes. These engineered cells will then be combined with fetal urogenital mesenchyme and engrafted under the mouse kidney capsule to produce prostate structures. We will evaluate tissue pathology and isolate regions of interest with aggressive tissue morphology (e.g., cribriform patterning) for RNA sequencing. Using this approach to model three mutually exclusive molecular subtypes, we can directly compare and contrasts gene expression and pathways changes to identify common and subtype-specific effects. Using these data, along with –omic data from patients, we will use two network-based computational models to identify novel therapeutic treatments and capture the systems-level gene regulation and functional relationships. The therapeutic predictions will be screened in vitro using engineered mouse and human cells with promising treatments being promoted for testing in the tissue recombination mouse model. Overall, through this project, we will study drivers of aggressive primary prostate cancer, characterize mechanisms of disease development, and identify pre-clinical pharmacological treatment strategies.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a dominant cellular component of the tumor stroma, play a significant role in drug resistance by contributing to the altered metabolism that is a hallmark of CRC. Despite many computational models of colorectal cancer growth and progression, there is currently no quantitative spatiotemporal description of the interactions between colon cancer cells and CAF cells, or the metabolic dependencies of these two cell populations. Thus, quantifying the collective cell dynamics (i.e. cooperation or competition) of tumor and CAF cells in their metabolic ecosystem may provide insight needed to develop optimal cancer therapies.<br><br>Our U01 addresses this limitation by applying a systems biology approach comprised of novel mathematical frameworks across scales, quantitative imaging techniques, and physiologically-relevant preclinical models to investigate reciprocal metabolic reprogramming that occurs between tumor cells and CAFs.

The central hypothesis of our CSBC is that functional perturbations emerging from cancer-specific gene expression of alternative isoforms are crucial for tumorigenesis.

GrantView,CA232209,Three-Dimensional Organoid Models to Study Breast Cancer Progression,CA232209,"Despite significant progress in the treatment of breast cancer, the transition of pre-invasive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to more aggressive invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) remains unknown. No prognostic biomarkers can reliably predict the risk of progression from DCIS to IDC. Similar genomic profiles of matched pre-invasive DCIS and IDC suggests that the progression is not driven by genetic aberrations in DCIS cells, but microenvironmental factors, such as hypoxia and metabolic stress prevalent in DCIS, may drive the transition. However, lack of experimental models with controlled microenvironments to capture the DCIS-IDC progression is impeding progress in the field.This collaborative study seeks to develop three-dimensional (3D) organoid models with controlled hypoxic microenvironments to recapitulate DCIS-IDC transition in the same parent tumors. The goal is to discover key hypoxia-induced factors involved in initiation, maintenance and spatial distribution of invasive breast cancer cells. The proposed work will utilize microfabricated hydrogel microwells to generate 3D organoids of DCIS cell lines and patient-derived cells with the goal to recapitulate three key hallmarks of DCIS-IDC transition observed in vivo: tumor-size induced hypoxia and metabolic stress, tumor heterogeneity, and spontaneous emergence of migratory phenotype in the same parent cells without any external stimulus. The microwell platform provides unique opportunity to define tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of DCIS-IDC transition. We will use integrated experimental and computational approaches coupled with CRISPR-based gene knock-in (fusion protein-labeling) and deep learning-based image analysis, to delineate how hypoxia, tumor secretome, and intracellular signaling networks work together to induce the migratory phenotype and drive progression to invasive disease.The research team consists of investigators from the University of Pittsburgh with expertise in biomaterials and tissue engineering (Sant, School of Pharmacy), mathematical and computational modeling and deep learning-based image analysis (Xing, Computational and Systems Biology), high resolution live cell imaging (Watkins, Center for Biological Imaging), tumor biology and proteomics (Donnenberg, School of Medicine), and clinical tumor biology and surgical oncology (McAuliffe, Magee-Womens Research Institute).The successful completion of the proposed work will lead to development of organoid models that will allow us to explore fundamental mechanisms responsible for emergence of migratory and invasive phenotypes.

Our goal is to identify and characterize, at a systems level, the dynamical flow of information through immune signaling networks in healthy individuals and ER+ BC patients and to understand how immune signaling defects at diagnosis reflect patients' immune responses, leading to different clinical outcomes. This work and its approach are motivated by our experience in immune signaling in cancer and our existing collaborations with oncologists and computational biologists at the City of Hope Cancer Center. We have shown that approximately 40% of ER+ BC patients harbor defects in their immune signaling network, specifically in signaling molecules called cytokines. Importantly, our preliminary data revealed major cytokine signaling abnormalities within immune cells from the peripheral blood of ER+ BC patients, which reflect immune activity within tumors and can predict cancer relapse years later. We believe that understanding how these cytokines interact with each other and other critical elements of the immune signaling network can ultimately lead to improved cancer treatments. Because the individual components of signaling networks interact in complicated and difficult-to-predict ways, we propose to apply a systems biology computational modeling approach. First, we propose to experimentally capture a rich data set of biological variables (molecular, genetic, and cellular data) using state-of-the-art technologies in peripheral blood collected from healthy people (Aim 1) and patients with ER+ BC (Aim 2). We will integrate these data into Bayesian networks, a way of modeling the data that will allow us to mathematically and statistically describe the relationships between cancer and measured variables. We will also perform high-dimensional histology and spatial image analysis of human ER+ breast tumors (Aim 3), then apply Bayesian networks and dynamical mathematical models to identify common immune features between tumor tissue (Aim 3) and peripheral blood (Aims 1 and 2), which we will also correlate with outcome. Impact and deliverables. This proposal will begin unraveling the complexity of the immune signaling network from a systems biology perspective.

In pre-clinical experiments and now with ongoing clinical trials, we have demonstrated that therapies incorporating evolutionary dynamics can significantly improve outcomes using currently available treatments. Major “lessons learned” from this experience include 1) Optimal therapy design requires maximal understanding of the multiscale dynamics that provide the “menu” of resistance strategies for cancer cells undergoing treatment; 2) The eco-evolutionary forces that govern response and resistance in cancer therapy are dominated by non-linear dynamics that defy intuitive analysis and can only be predicted through mathematical models and computational simulation; and 3) Clinical data are typically sparse and can be obtained only in periodic “snapshots” from biopsies or imaging studies. Converting static information to evolutionary dynamics requires mathematical tools. In this U01 we will apply these investigational principles to immunotherapy for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). During the past decade, the Moffitt Thoracic Oncology Department has pioneered new strategies using immunotherapy for NSCLC. In almost 500 patients treated with immunotherapy at Moffitt, the response rate (CR, PR, and SD) is 30 to 45%.

This collaborative study will create a foundation for tumor tissue engineering by employing multiple innovative methodologies to first characterize and then build biomimetic models of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the tumor microenvironment. The ECM is a key element in biomimicry, and particularly important to consider in the context of cancer, where the composition and architecture of the ECM change drastically with disease progression.The team consists of experts in the ovarian cancer tumor microenvironment (Kreeger, UW-Madison), biomaterials and tissue engineering (Masters, UW-Madison), imaging of the ECM (Campagnola, UW-Madison), ovarian cancer (Patankar, UW-Madison), pathology (Weisman, UW-Madison), and mass spectrometry of the ECM (Naba, UIC).We will specifically focus upon high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), which is associated with a particularly poor survival rate of less than 50%.

GrantView,CA234787,Predicting patient-specific responses to personalize androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer,CA234787,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most prevalent cancer in men in the US. A major obstacle in PCa therapy is that continuous treatment at maximum tolerable doses often renders the tumor resistant. PCa is comprised of androgen-independent cancer stem cells (PCaSC) and more differentiated, androgen-dependent PCa cells (PCaC) that make up the bulk of the tumor. Treatment-induced enrichment in PCaSC appears to confer therapy resistance. Continuous treatment neglects the evolutionary dynamics where competition, adaptation and selection between treatment-sensitive and -resistant cells contribute to therapy failure. Intermittent androgen deprivation therapy (IADT) with on-and off-treatment cycles may counteract competitive release of androgen-independent cancer cells and delay time to progression (TTP). Successful clinical implementation of IADT requires identification of resistance mechanisms, prediction of responses, and determination of clinically actionable triggers for pausing and resuming IADT cycles. We propose to integrate our mathematical, biological, clinical, and statistical expertise to test the hypothesis that PCaSC dynamics underlie response to therapy and evolution of resistance in IADT. By fitting different mechanistic mathematical models to retrospective longitudinal data of individual patients in a training data set we can determine clinically plausible model parameter distributions. From treatment response dynamics in early treatment cycles, we aim to simulate and reliably forecast an individual patient's response to subsequent treatment cycles in a validation data set. Then, we will use the validated model to simulate IADT protocols with different cycle intervals for each patient. Nominal and relative cutoffs for PSA levels to pause and resume IADT will be simulated and TTP will be determined. PSA cutoffs that maximize TTP will be correlated with model-derived PCaSC dynamics and used to identify optimal patient-specific IADT protocols. Compared to androgen deprivation alone, co-treatment with docetaxel (DOC) improves patient survival with the survival benefit dependent on treatment timing. We will simulate DOC therapy initialized at different IADT cycles to determine DOC timing- dependent TTP in correlation to patient-specific PCaSC dynamics parameters to further improve PCa treatment outcomes. This exploratory high-risk and high-reward project may provide a significant conceptual advance in PCa treatment, away from continuous androgen deprivation at maximum tolerable dose until the tumor becomes resistant towards an IADT protocol, using triggers based on individual patients' response dynamics.

GrantView,CA235747,Uncovering the Biology of Resistance to Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in EGFR Mutant Lung Cancer Patient-Derived Models,CA235747,"A long-standing clinical observation is that metastatic cancers are refractory to treatment. Even with the advent of molecularly targeted therapies, drug resistance almost always emerges and patients ultimately succumb to further metastatic spread of the cancer. In the case of EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), tumors can acquire resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) while spreading to the liver and brain. The mechanisms linking these morbid outcomes remain poorly understood. Here, we propose to study the biological properties of EGFR mutant tumors as they evolve through TKI treatment, identify the factors that allow treated tumor cells to persist and how features of the metastatic niche and depth (or durability) of responses to TKIs are linked. We hypothesize that, 1) the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor cell extrinsic factors are critical determinants of disseminated tumor cell persistence following TKI treatment and 2) that the reliance on these factors decreases in highly resistant metastasis through sequential TKI treatment. To study this hypothesis, we have successfully established a repeat biopsy program to collect and analyze lung cancer specimens, including EGFR mutant LUADs before and after TKI treatment. Through this program we have established >20 patient-derived models of EGFR mutant LUAD, including organoid cultures and subcutaneous and orthotopic patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). In Aim 1, we will generate additional patient- derived models of cancer (PDMCs) as organoids, subcutaneous or orthotopic PDXs, collected from 10 patients with EGFR mutant LUAD longitudinally prior to TKI treatment and at acquired resistance to TKIs. These PDMCs will be genomically and histologically characterized, while their TKI sensitivity will be compared to the patient specimens. In Aim 2, we will leverage these models to determine the mechanisms by which TKI resistance affects the aggressiveness of EGFR mutant tumors. Using paired pre- and post-TKI PDMCs, we will evaluate the latency and site of relapse of these tumors. We will also determine how known mechanisms of TKI resistance affect the metastatic properties of EGFR mutant tumors and identify novel dual molecular mediators of resistance and metastasis. Finally, in Aim3, we will Identify tissue-specific determinants of tumor cell persistence following TKI treatment. Focusing on tumors that we know are responsive to specific TKIs, we will establish whether tumors implanted in different sites of metastases exhibit different sensitivity to TKIs and identify the cellular, molecular and pharmacological determinants of these differences. We will test the mechanistic prediction that the stromal extracellular matrix modulates the ability of tumor cells to persist upon TKI treatment. Thoracic malignancies account for most cancer-related deaths.

We propose to leverage genomic and proteomic data from a rich animal model system, and 2 human clinical trials, to build predictive models of the EGFR-MAPK signaling pathway activity for TNBC patients. The heterogeneity of TNBC has hindered previous development of predictive pathway-based computational models because most approaches are based on experimental data from a single cell line or animal model that is then extrapolated to fit multiple tumor subtypes. Our approach is to use a diverse experimental model system that reflects the heterogeneous disease subtypes, and then use two distinct and complementary methods to build the computational model.

GrantView,CA238720,Identification of personalized adaptive response mechanisms in breast cancer by information theory and proteomics,CA238720,"Over the past decade the accumulation of large-scale systems level data sets has occurred at an accelerating pace. Unfortunately, to date this massive accumulation of biological and medical information has rarely translated into truly efficacious therapies that dramatically alter the course of disease. Clearly new informatics approaches are needed that will enable the identification of transformative therapeutics. The central goal of this proposal is to develop an experimental-theoretical approach that defines, with high accuracy, the altered protein network structures present in each cancer malignancy. We propose to integrate quantitative mass spectrometry- based protein and protein phosphorylation measurements with surprisal analysis, a thermodynamic-based information theory approach, to resolve altered protein network structure in each malignancy. An altered network in each patients' tumor may comprise several distinct, sometimes rewired, protein subnetworks that drive the molecular imbalance in cancer tissue. Identification of unbalanced subnetworks will highlight molecular nodes that will be targeted in each patient to either restore the basal, non-transformed state or to decrease tumor cell viability. To demonstrate the ability of this approach to define unbalanced subnetworks and their associated therapeutic targets, the proposal is divided into three phases with increasing complexity and physiological relevance. In the first phase, RTK networks in breast cancer cell lines representing different subtypes will be stimulated with natural ligands to induce well characterized unbalanced processes to validate the ability of surprisal analysis to identify these networks. In the second phase, unbalanced processes present in the basal, unstimulated state of each cell line will be defined. Therapeutic targeting of these processes, alone or in combination, at high and low dose, will be performed to assess the effect of complete vs. incomplete inhibition. Unbalanced processes mediating the development of therapeutic resistance during long-term low- dose treatment will be quantified at various time points to predict combination therapies to abrogate resistance.

Nodes in these imbalanced networks will be targeted to decrease tumor viability. Combination with chemotherapy may further sensitize tumor cells to treatment.

GrantView,CA238728,Systems analysis of cell-cell communication networks and immune activity in the melanoma tumor microenvironment,CA238728,"Cancer immunotherapy, which harnesses a patient’s own immune system to fight cancer, has revolutionized cancer treatment. Combination immunotherapy targeting the T cell checkpoint inhibitors PD-1 and CTLA-4 has been particularly effective in treating metastatic melanoma. Despite this success, a significant fraction of melanoma patients remains unresponsive to current checkpoint inhibitor combination therapy, and thus there is an urgent need to identify new targets to treat these patients. However, efforts to identify effective therapeutic targets are limited by our incomplete understanding of the molecular determinants that distinguish an ineffective anti-tumor immune response from an effective one.The goal of our U01 project is to advance cancer immunotherapy by defining networks of intercellular secreted signals that establish immunological activity in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The rationale for the proposed research is that identifying cell-cell interactions that distinguish immunosuppressive versus immunosupportive TMEs will serve as a roadmap of new targets to test in unresponsive tumors. Our project takes advantage of the availability of single-cell measurements that enable the simultaneous profiling of thousands of cells isolated from tumor microenvironments from mouse models of melanoma and from human melanoma patients. We will computationally analyze these data to construct cell-cell interaction networks between stromal, tumor, and immune cells to identify interactions that maintain immunosuppressive TMEs, and to quantify how these interactions are altered in response to cancer immunotherapy. We will use our models to identify the most important interactions, predict how to target them, and test these predictions experimentally. We are particularly interested in how the functional plasticity of macrophages and other myeloid cells contributes to an immunosuppressive TME in mice and human melanomas. With respect to cancer systems biology, the proposed research is innovative because it will combine new computational methods–for defining cell subsets and network interactions from scRNA-seq data and constructing predictive classification models–with syngeneic mouse melanoma models and human patient samples that are ideally suited to evaluate CIT responses. The proposed research is significant because it will redefine the hallmarks of immune activity in the TME as emergent properties of multiple cell-cell interactions that can be pharmacologically targeted to design immunotherapies that will be effective on non-responding patients.",U01,"Microenvironment, Tumor-Immune","Yale University, Salk Institute for Biological Studies","Yale, Salk","Kathryn Miller-Jensen, Marcus Bosenberg, Susan Kaech, Harriet Kluger",CSBC,7/1/20,6/30/25,https://reporter.nih.gov/search/nSEq7PsdkUukyCuIUaTm0A/projects,4,,https://www.synapse.org/#!Team:3471130,https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn22092596,41228e09-d474-4f77-8353-b74f2736a8ca,syn53259587
GrantView,CA240301,Dynamic Interactions of the Ovarian-Fallopian Axis in High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer,CA240301,"Ovarian cancer is the 5th leading cause of cancer related death in women. If detected early, the chance of survival is over 90%, but most women are diagnosed in the late stages of disease when cancer has spread throughout the peritoneal space. It is now recognized that a large percentage of high grade serous ovarian cancers arise in the fallopian tube and colonize the ovary as the primary metastatic step. Since one of the largest tumor masses tends to be found in the ovary after diagnosis, this raises the possibility that the ovary contributes to tumor spread and aggressiveness. One of the risk factors associated with ovarian cancer is the lifetime number of ovulations.Few models are currently available that allow the process of ovulation and the development of ovarian cancer to be studied. To address this gap, we propose to create in vitro models of the fallopian-ovarian interaction within a normal ovulation context to examine key aspects of the ovarian microenvironment during tumor initiation and progression. These results will be compared to in vivo murine models.Our goals are:1. To define the contribution of ovulation and follicular fluid on tumor initiation in the fallopian tube.2. To engineer an ovarian metastasis model and investigate the role of versican as a secreted factor enhancing tumor cell colonization of the ovary.3.

GrantView,CA241137,A microengineered colon cancer-chip designed to investigate tumor-stromal interactions driving cancer progression,CA241137,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Despite the introduction of novel therapies, the five-year survival rate for metastatic disease remains around 10%. To improve our understanding of tumor progression and drug efficacy, it is vital to develop preclinical tumor models that accurately reflect the native pathophysiology of CRC “ex vivo”. The complexities of the tumor microenvironment (TME), including stromal cell types and mechanical forces, are not fully reproduced in existing preclinical models. Microfluidic-based “organ-on-chip” technologies, which are designed to simulate the 3-D human organ environment both mechanically (e.g., fluid flow and cyclic deformation) and biochemically (e.g., nutrient digestion, secretion, transport), have recently provided researchers with greater insights into and expanded control over the TME. In this proposal, we are adapting the organ-on-chip technology to create human colon organ chips colonized with patient-derived CRC cells and stromal elements (endothelial and cancer- associated fibroblast (CAF) cells) in relevant tissue:tissue compartments with integrated microfluidics and stretching to mimic in vivo peristalsis-like motions. The goal is to create a physiologically relevant, organ- dependent tumor model that will allow for long-term culture and characterization of CRC cellular dynamics, and serve as a platform for testing specific therapeutic modalities to prevent or delay tumor progression. Using novel imaging assays and “omics” based approaches, we will evaluate the role of the physical (i.e., peristalsis) and cellular (CAFs) microenvironment in colon tumor progression. In Aim 1, we will develop patient- derived CRC-on-Chips incorporating primary normal and tumor epithelium to assess CRC tumor growth and early metastatic spread (i.e., invasion into the vascular channel) in the presence of cyclic stretch, mimicking peristalsis. In Aim 2, we will analyze the impact of the stromal CAF microenvironment on tumor cell behavior and examine the extent and role of inter-patient CAF functional heterogeneity. In Aim 3, we will assess the drug screening capabilities of the CRC-on-Chip platform via monitoring of drug-induced cellular responses, and determine whether drug responses on chips can predict patient clinical responses. The longer-term vision for developing a microengineered CRC model that more closely resembles human disease is to expedite the identification and screening of novel drug targets and innovative treatment strategies with a focus on disrupting tumor-stromal interactions.

GrantView,CA241927,Tissue-Engineered Models of Microvessel-Mediated Glioblastoma Invasion,CA241927,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a uniformly fatal brain cancer with poor response to treatment and virtually inevitable recurrence. GBM tumors rarely metastasize and, instead, aggressively infiltrate the brain. Tumor borders are highly vascularized by microvessels that serve as key niche environments promoting GBM cell survival, treatment resistance and migration. Currently, it is believed that a subpopulation of treatment-resistant, stem-like GBM cells migrate away from primary tumors — remaining in close contact with local microvessels — and seed recurrent tumors. However, the mechanisms underlying the influence of the microvessel niche on GBM cell migration away from primary tumors, leading to recurrence, remain largely unknown. This project aims to investigate 1) the role of specific cues in the tumor microenvironment on the migratory phenotype of GBM cells and 2) how these cues differentially affect distinct subpopulations of cells within heterogeneous tumors.The research team from the UCLA consists of an expert in biomaterials and neural tissue engineering (Seidlits, PI), neurologist and developmental and cancer cell biologist (Kornblum, co-I), geneticist and bioinformatics expert (Li, co-I), radiation oncologist (Pajonk, collaborator) and expert in GBM metabolism and cell biology (Nathanson, co-I).These studies will use tissue-engineered platforms for 3D culture of patient-derived GBM cells to quantify how specific features of the GBM microenvironment affect migratory behavior of tumor cells. Orthogonal modulation of mechanical and chemical properties in culture platforms will facilitate characterization of their independent effects on migratory cell phenotype. Platforms will be constructed with an interface between defined microenvironments through which GBM cells can migrate, enabling separation of migratory and non-migratory cells for downstream analysis and providing information about how subpopulations of cells within a single tumor may respond differentially to microenvironmental cues using single-cell RNA sequencing. As treatment resistance, invasion and recurrence are inter-related events, we will investigate how exposure to routine clinical therapies may alter migratory responses of GBM cells to microenvironmental cues.

GrantView,CA243004,Multiscale analysis of metabolic inflammation as a driver of breast cancer,CA243004,"In this U01 project, we address an urgent and understudied problem. Breast cancer patients with co-morbid metabolic disease, such as Type 2 diabetes, are more likely to experience tumor progression, metastasis and earlier mortality than breast cancer patients with normal metabolism. Type 2 diabetes drives progression of aggressive estrogen receptor negative and triple negative breast cancer subtypes, in particular. As a chronic inflammatory disease, Type 2 diabetes features abnormal T cell polarization and a more dangerous tumor microenvironment; for example, the breast adipose tissue is inflamed/apoptotic. Published and preliminary data show abnormal expression in Type 2 diabetes of immune checkpoint receptors on T cell subsets in both periphery and tumor infiltrates. Type 2 diabetes patients lose T cell tumor surveillance, favoring escape of micrometastases from the primary tumor. Yet existing approaches to breast tumor progression and immuno-oncology therapies are built on metabolically healthier cancer patients, rather than among underserved patient populations where the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes and triple negative breast cancer is high. We will develop computational models that consider previously unappreciated variables that may critically inform outcomes. These variables have never been inputs to systems level studies of breast cancer progression. Abundant data support a central hypothesis: Type 2 diabetes worsens the inflammatory and immune exhaustion mechanisms that promote more aggressive tumor progression in the microenvironment of estrogen receptor negative breast cancer. Yet, strikingly, existing breast co-culture and organoid models to explore microenvironment and immunotherapy have ignored the metabolic and inflammatory components of Type 2 diabetes. Models built on relatively healthy women are inappropriate to understand mechanisms that are important for the millions of Americans with Type 2 diabetes and related co-morbid metabolic conditions. Therefore, our innovative, multidisciplinary team of investigators is developing improved models to address this knowledge gap. The crosstalk between exhausted T cells in tumor infiltrates, metabolic abnormalities and tumor aggressiveness can only be modeled with systems biology approaches that consider the microenvironment, and are informed by breast cancer epidemiological data, grounded in real clinical experience, and supported by population science. Our talented team aims to achieve exactly this goal. We drive development of multi-scale computational modeling of breast cancer progression, focusing on estrogen receptor negative/triple negative breast cancer in women with Type 2 diabetes. We are developing breast cancer organoids and exploring the function of T cell subsets in tumor cell killing, to generate and integrate metabolic, inflammatory, and immune signatures derived by multi-omic profiling, encompassing RNA-seq, quantitative (phospho)proteomics and immunophenotype, of tumors, immune cells, and organoid models to interrogate the molecular processes driving disease crosstalk at multiple levels. We are also developing new algorithms to model how Type 2 diabetes rewires immune cell signaling and metabolism in a prospective study of breast cancer patients in a safety net hospital, and testing, refining and validating these networks in organoid models. We iteratively combine computation, clinical observation and organoid experiments to develop multiscale models that reveal novel, clinically relevant immuno-oncology markers and targets. The long term impacts of this research are important for over 100 million Americans with diabetes/pre-diabetes, who are predisposed to more aggressive cancers, compared to cancer patients who are metabolically normal, yet for whom the standard of care has not fully addressed the relevant mechanisms of progression, immune exhaustion, metastasis or chemoresistance.",U01,"Microenvironment, Metastasis","Boston University, Boston Medical Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital","BU, BMC, BIDMC","Gerald Denis, Naomi Ko, Stefano Monti, Andrew Emili, Senthil Muthuswamy",CSBC,9/9/20,8/31/25,https://reporter.nih.gov/search/edhl6xx2pkKvUbLa7v8C7A/projects,4,,https://www.synapse.org/#!Team:3471131,https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn23651456,b6bceb73-9c43-4959-867b-d6e95bd7e06b,syn53259587
GrantView,CA243007,Optimal control models of epithelial-mesenchymal transition for the design of pancreas cancer combination therapy,CA243007,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal and common cancer, with an overall five-year survival rate of 6%. Among the factors contributing to this dismal statistic is the observation that epithelial- derived PDAC cells, sometimes in direct response to therapy, can de-differentiate to a mesenchymal state in which they are more chemoresistant. This observation prompts the question: should epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) be targeted to promote therapeutic response and increase patient survival? The main barrier to exploring this idea is that we do not know how to target EMT precisely, especially in light of the complex multivariate cell signaling dynamics that drive EMT and maintain it as a feedback response to chemotherapy. We recently undertook a preliminary study to identify a group of druggable cell signaling pathways that may cooperatively drive the mesenchymal state in PDAC. However, the translational potential of our current analysis is limited in that it merely identified potential targets; it does not provide any systematic actionable understanding, nor testable predictions, of how best to schedule combinations of drugs in time to maximize therapeutic efficacy and minimize unintended toxicity. Consequently, we now seek to extend our preliminary studies to develop a systems biology platform for the systematic determination of scheduled combination therapy approaches for PDAC designed to maximally suppress EMT during treatment. In Aim 1, we will make dynamic measurements of signaling pathway activity and cell phenotypes in PDAC cells treated with drivers of EMT, antagonists of EMT, and chemotherapeutics. Our measurements will cover those pathways already identified in our preliminary work as the most likely druggable regulators of EMT, and will include the effects of hypoxia and cancer-associated fibroblasts, elements of the tumor microenvironment that may impact EMT regulation. The goal is to obtain an information-rich data set to be used subsequently for model identification and control computations. In Aim 2, we will use the dynamic data to develop the computational platform for determining optimal changes to the drivers and antagonists required to achieve maximal suppression of EMT, to be implemented as scheduled combination therapies for PDAC. This will be accomplished through: (i) identification of a dynamic model for epithelial or mesenchymal cell state determination in response to phosphoprotein perturbations (i.e., quantitative characterization, in the form of a computational model, the EMT response to changes in its drivers and antagonists) and (ii) deploying the model “in reverse” to determine, via optimal control principles, how best to combine and schedule drugs for optimal maintenance of the epithelial phenotype. In Aim 3, we will test the model-based schedules for combination therapy in a sequence of in vitro and in vivo experiments. Ultimately, these studies will provide pre-clinical validation for a new strategy to develop therapeutic regimens that target a pathological process in PDAC that limits therapeutic response.

GrantView,CA243072,Towards rational design of combination therapeutic targets,CA243072,"Given the prevalence of crosstalk among oncogenic pathways and disease heterogeneity, it has become increasingly apparent that combination therapies are required to achieve long-term cure and to minimize development of resistance mutations and escape pathways. The majority of existing combination therapies are developed in an ad hoc fashion, namely one agent at a time, without systematic consideration of potential complex interactions among the gene targets by leveraging disease-specific omics data. Moreover, the existing combination therapies are based on targets of existing drugs, which only represent a small portion of the human proteome. To this end, we hypothesize that systematic identification of synergistic key regulators represents a promising approach for nominating targets of combination therapy. Towards this goal, we will forward engineer a platform for identifying synergistic regulatory nodes in a cancer gene regulatory network as the targets for combination therapy. We will generate disease-specific multi-omics data to construct an integrative gene regulatory network, a pre-requisite for understanding the deregulated gene network in the cancer cells and for developing effective and lasting therapy.

Peripheral T-cell lymphomas are frequently associated with the presence of Epstein-Barr virus whose role in the disease remains largely uncharacterized.

GrantView,CA244100,Predict radiation-induced shifts in patient-specific tumor immune ecosystem composition to harness immunological consequences of radiotherapy,CA244100,"Tumor-associated antigens, stress proteins, and danger-associated molecular patterns are endogenous immune adjuvants that can both initiate and continually stimulate an immune response against a tumor. In retaliation, tumors can hijack intrinsic immune regulatory programs, thereby facilitating continued growth despite an activated antitumor immune response. Clinically apparent tumors have co-evolved with the patient’s immune system and form a complex Tumor-Immune EcoSystem (TIES). The success of radiotherapy (RT) may be the result of radiation shifting the relative proportions of tumor and immune cells such that surviving cancer cells are subject to elimination by the immune system. However, current RT fractionation has not specifically focused on enhancing immune responses, nor has immune cell infiltration into the tumor as biomarker been considered to predict treatment response. We hypothesize that patients with a TIES such that radiation debulks the tumor and induces a robust immune response may be cured. A TIES with weak antitumor-immunity or strong immune suppression may not be sufficiently perturbed by current RT dose fractionation to fully harness radiation-immune synergy and provide tumor control. The goal of the project is to combine experimental studies and clinical data to calibrate and rigorously validate the in silico framework that simulates the influence of different TIES compositions on the response to different radiation doses and dose fractionations. We will focus on oropharyngeal cancer, one of the few cancer types increasing in incidence. In vivo tumors with and without tumor specific T cells provide radiation dose and fractionation-dependent changes in immune infiltration to derive in silico model parameters. For clinical analysis we will use a retrospective cohort of 51 oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) tissue samples as training cohort. We will prospectively collect radiosensitivity and immune infiltration data from 105 OPC patients that undergo radiation therapy with different total doses, dependent on their intrinsic radiosensitivity index (RSI). These data serve as a test cohort to validate model outcome predictions against clinical assessment of complete response at 3 months. Our overall aims are to determine radiation dose and fractionation that optimize radiation-induced immunity, and to identify how to use RT to shift a patient-specific TIES toward immune-modulated tumor elimination. These aims will motivate profound changes to how we conceive of and clinically prescribe RT. Radiation could be understood as immunotherapy. For patients with unfavorable TIES, RT fractionation protocols should focus on the radical perturbation of the TIES toward immune-modulated tumor control. For favorable TIES, dose could be de-escalated with focus on immune activation.

While standard of care treatments (androgen deprivation therapy-ADT, chemotherapy) are initially effective, this heterogeneous disease often evolves to become resistant, thus representing a major clinical challenge. Our group also demonstrates that the bone ecosystem contributes to the emergence of resistant mPCa but how the ecosystem in turn, impacts the efficacy of standard of care treatment represents a major gap in our knowledge. Biology driven mathematical models offer a novel and effective means with which to address these complex issues since cancer evolution and bone ecosystem responses to applied therapies can be rapidly tested, optimized for efficacy to delay the onset of resistant disease, and subsequently, validated experimentally. Using empirical data, we will generate an agent-based mathematical model to describe the interactions of heterogeneous mPCa cells with the surrounding bone microenvironment. In silico, we will test the effect of standard of care treatments ADT (Lupron) and chemotherapy (docetaxel) on the growth of cancer over time. The model can identify the impact of these treatments on mPCa cells but also the role of other bone cell types such as, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in disease progression. Based on this rationale, we hypothesize that experimentally powered HCAs can be used to dissect the bone ecosystem effects on mPCa evolution and optimize treatment strategies so as to prevent the emergence of resistant disease. To test this hypothesis, we propose three interdisciplinary aims. In Aim 1, human prostate cancer cell line (VCaP and LAPC4) growth parameters will power a hybrid cellular automaton (HCA) agent-based mathematical model of heterogeneous mPCa in bone. The response of the model to standard of care therapy (ADT and or docetaxel) will be studied and results validated in vivo. In Aim 2, we will explore the role of the bone ecosystem, specifically MSCs, in controlling the emergence of resistance to standard of care treatments. Human data will be used to assess the clinical applicability of the eco-evolutionary HCA. In Aim 3, evolutionary algorithms (EA) will be used to guide the adaptive application of standard of care therapy. Our innovative studies will; 1) generate a robust mathematical eco-evolutionary model of bone mPCa that can be used to dissect the role of the bone microenvironment in the emergence of resistance, 2) identify the effects of standard of care therapies on heterogeneous cancer cells and the bone ecosystem and, 3) allow for the rapid determination of optimized adaptive therapies that take into account the contributions of the bone ecosystem.

GrantView,CA244107,Biophysical roles of pre-metastatic niche evolution on transport of circulating tumor cells,CA244107,"Exploring the earliest events that promote circulating tumor cells (CTCs) to immobilize on blood vessel walls at future metastatic sites will expose new targets for rational prevention. Studies suggest that distant microenvironments are primed and ready to entrap CTCs, creating a pre-metastatic niche for initiating metastasis. In addition to biological mechanisms, the physical transport of CTC in blood vessels and biophysical interaction of CTC with the pre-metastatic niche can be regarded as key determinants of metastatic potential. Whereas biological effects of circulating platelet (PLT) on CTCs and PLT accumulating to primary and metastatic tumors to support tumor growth and invasion are known, the roles of PLT in the initiation and development of the pre-metastatic niche and biophysical effects of the PLT on transport of CTCs in blood vessels have not been reported.Our objective is to elucidate and validate biophysical roles of the pre-metastatic niche initiated with PLT in the future metastatic site on CTC transport. We integrate orthotopic mouse tumor models using cell lines with different metastatic potentials, novel microfluidics pre-coated with or without PLT, and multiscale/multi-physics computational transport models. Our hypotheses are: 1) there is an organ- and time-dependent initiation/evolution of the pre-metastatic niche, wherein deposited and activated PLT on vessel walls in mice bearing primary tumors alters hydrodynamics of CTCs and their interactions; 2) only the pre-metastatic niche, which is sufficiently developed to significantly alter these biophysical parameters, promotes immobilization of CTCs on vessel walls; and 3) modulation of PLT functionality by anti-PLT reagents affects biophysical roles of PLTs on CTC transport and the prospect of metastasis. The multiscale/multi-physics transport modeling provides optimized parameterization of metastasis based on experimental results in vitro and in vivo to characterize transport phenomena of CTCs and phenotype pre-metastatic niches. The significance of this study will establish a scientific framework for understanding undiscovered biophysical roles of the pre-metastatic niche initiated with PLTs on transport of CTCs for rational prevention of metastasis using anti-PLT reagents.",U01,"Metastasis, Microenvironment","Houston Methodist, Weill Cornell Medicine, University of Washington","Houston Methodist, WCM, UW","Kenji Yokoi, Lidong Qin, Milos Kojic",PS-ON,2/15/20,1/31/25,https://reporter.nih.gov/search/ZdQWQAEDF02BzrcGwvWc4A/projects,4,,https://www.synapse.org/#!Team:3471112,https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn22115132,5ca0d6a1-ce27-498e-9107-c6b7164b17c1,syn53259587
GrantView,CA244109,Understanding breast cancer progression as a defect in the mechanics of tissue self-organization,CA244109,"A progressive breakdown in the bilayered structure of the mammary epithelium is the hallmark of all breast cancers, but the structural change that occurs between ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is of particular importance because it represents a major inflection point in risk for patients. Breast cancers originate in the inner luminal layer of the mammary epithelium, where transformed luminal epithelial cells (LEP) proliferate to fill the ducts and lobules in DCIS. Surprisingly, LEP in DCIS have acquired all the necessary genetic aberrations to invade, but remain constrained within the tissue by an intact outer myoepithelial (MEP) layer—a group of cells that forms a dynamic barrier blocking access of the in situ tumor to the basement membrane (BM, the specialized extracellular matrix (ECM) that surrounds the mammary epithelium).Translocation of transformed LEP past the MEP layer has been proposed as the rate-limiting step in progression to IDC. Here, we aim to identify the physical and molecular changes that must occur in LEP to facilitate this structural transition. We approach this challenge through the lens of mammary epithelial self-organization. We hypothesize the existence of a rate-limiting structural intermediate during the progression of DCIS to IDC, where LEP translocate into the MEP layer, next to the BM. We propose a statistical mechanical framework for understanding how perturbations to the mechanics and dynamics of tumor cells facilitate the formation of this intermediate and propose to test this concept using complementary in vitro and in vivo experimental systems: using organoids reconstituted from human reduction mammoplasty tissues and genetically engineered mouse models.Our long-term goal is to reveal the changes that promote and inhibit progression from DCIS to IDC. Better physical and molecular predictors of progression would benefit DCIS patients who would otherwise be over-treated, as only a third of DCIS cases progress to IDC.

Current in vitro models such as 2D cell cultures or 3D tumoroids do not contain this niche environment. Mouse models of brain tumors can recapitulate some aspects of the PVN, but have major limitations including high cost, low throughput, and the inability to perform live cell tracking of individual BTSCs. Herein, we propose to develop a tissue-engineered 3D microvascular niche-on-a-chip model that can incorporate primary brain tumor cells from patients in order to bridge this gap between in vitro and in vivo models.Our pilot study has demonstrated the success in co-culture of patient-derived glioblastoma cells and microvasculature in a microfluidic gel system and observed preferential localization of BTSCs in the PVN. Comparing ex vivo dynamics of individual tumor cells on-chip to single-cell transcriptomes across 10 patients further revealed a correlation between perivascular localization and transcriptional subtypes. In this project, we propose to further examine tumor cell migration and localization using a larger cohort of patient specimens and compare the results to pathological and clinical data, aiming to develop it into an ex vivo functional assay for patient prognosis and subclassification (Aim 1). We will apply scRNA-seq to the same samples to generate correlative data to identify subtypes associated with distinct ex vivo dynamics in the tissue-engineered PVN model, which can help elucidate the molecular mechanisms of PVN in tumor cell fate and invasion (Aim 2). Finally, we will investigate the response of tumor cells in PVN to chemo and targeted therapies administered through the perfusable microvascular network to assess the potential to perform personalized drug test and therapeutic stratification (Aim 3).

GrantView,CA248890,3-Dimensional Retinal Organoid Platform for the Study of Retinoblastoma,CA248890,"Retinoblastoma (Rb) is the most common eye cancer in children and a significant contributor to childhood cancer deaths worldwide. Rb tumors arise from biallelic loss of the RB1 gene during retinal development in-utero, and are uniformly lethal if left untreated. While clinical management of the tumor has advanced in recent decades, the non-specific and highly toxic nature of current therapies frequently result in life-long visual compromise and health complications. Similarly, the exorbitant cost and limited access to advanced procedures render the best treatment options inaccessible to most children worldwide, where eye removal remains the only life-saving option for patients. However, the social stigma and psychological effects of eye removal often lead parents to forego treatment, resulting in survival rates below 50% in many regions of the world. The most significant barrier to progress in developing targeted selective therapies for retinoblastoma is the gap in knowledge regarding the molecular drivers of retinoblastoma progression. Currently, no laboratory models exist, animal or otherwise, which faithfully recapitulate the human manifestation of this disease, and the limited amount of information available comes from tumors which necessitate removal, thus only providing a snapshot of the molecular mechanisms present in advanced cases. The ability to study these tumors in earlier stages, including their pre- malignant phase would shed light into the molecular drivers of Rb progression, lead to more targeted therapies which obviate the need for eye removal, ideally preserving vision but, more importantly, save lives. Recently, we have developed a human iPSC-based 3-Dimensional retinal organoid differentiation protocol and tissue culture bioreactor system in which we can control various environmental parameters critical for proper retinal development. Using this platform, we can use gene editing to introduce the most prevalent mutations found in Rb tumors and evaluate their effect on retinal development and tumor formation. We have shown how some of these mutations lead to amplification of a pre-malignant undifferentiated mutant cell clone, and disrupt terminal differentiation of other retinal cell types. We now propose to establish this platform as the first model system in which the various aspects of human Rb tumors can be elucidated, from their initiation through the drivers of malignant transformation. In order to achieve this, we aim to 1) Optimize, validate, and deploy our tissue bioreactor system to recapitulate the microenvironment of the developing retina, 2) use gene editing technology to establish the physiologic pattern of mutation acquisition during retinogenesis which leads to Rb tumor formation, and 3) use our 3D retinal organoid platform to screen pharmacological compounds that can address the molecular determinants of Rb tumor progression.",R01,"Tumor Progression, Platform Development",University of Miami,U Miami,"Daniel Pelaez, William Harbour",TEC,9/15/20,6/30/25,https://reporter.nih.gov/search/SMFk3_TNz0KScrMKMqiajA/projects,4,,https://www.synapse.org/#!Team:3471151,https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn35270490,aba5862e-7396-445c-a4c3-68a3fe5e4c59,syn53259587

We assembled an interdisciplinary team of leading experts in bioengineering, cancer biology, systems biology, pathology and oncology to establish such model. Based on extensive prior work, we propose to develop a state-of-the art “cancer patient on a chip” of invasive human breast carcinoma. The tumor will be physiologically integrated with their cognate metastatic sites (lung, liver, bone) via vascular perfusion containing circulating cells. The tumor compartment will be established directly from surgical specimens grown in 3D, organotypic conditions while target metastatic sites and vasculature will be established from blood-derived, patient-matched iPS cells, under an active institutional review board protocol. The system is imaging compatible and supports long-term culture (up to 12 weeks). Biological fidelity and heterogeneity of primary and metastatic sites, as implemented in the context of such vascularized multi-tissue platform, will be validated by single-cell analyses vs. the corresponding native tumor. For these studies, we will recruit a cohort of patients with metastatic tumors. Our ultimate goal is to demonstrate utility of the platform in elucidating mechanisms of tumor progression and drug resistance, by testing drug panels predicted by a novel RNA-seq-based, NY CLIA certified methodology (OncoTreat). Our hypothesis is that our system will recapitulate key properties of the metastatic breast adenocarcinoma and enable identification of target proteins that mechanistically drive tumor progression and drug sensitivity/resistance.

GrantView,CA250040,Exploiting the Mechanobiology of PD-1 for Cancer Immunotherapy,CA250040,"Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) is one of the key co-inhibitory molecules upregulated upon T cell activation and is a hallmark of T-cell exhaustion. Despite the fact that PD-1 blockade has become a revolutionary strategy in treating cancer and infectious diseases, the mechanobiology of PD-1 has not been studied. This is the gap that tne present Physical Science – Oncology Project (PS-OP) aims to fill. The significance of the PS-OP’s unique mechanobiology angle lies in the therapeutic potential of targeting the mechanoregulation of PD-1 to treat a wide variety of diseases, including melanoma, which is the focus of this PS-OP. The approaches of the PS-OP’s multidisciplinary team combine four physical science (PS) tools with two mouse models of melanoma. They represent the unique strength of the Zhu lab and the Ahmed lab, and enable investigation of PD-1 mechanobiology in silico, in vitro and in vivo. The first PS tool is DNA-based mechanical tension probes (MTP) and tension gauge tethers (TGT) that report and limit, respectively, cell-generated forces on PD-1. The second PS tool is three biomembrane force probe (BFP)-based single-molecule methods that quantify force regulation of in situ PD-1–PD-ligand interactions with concurrent imaging of intracellular signals in single cells. The third PS tool is molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that reveal structural changes of PD-1 in complex with its ligands under force and the bonding dynamics at atomic level. The fourth PS-tool is microfluidic-based devices for cell trapping, stimulation, and analysis. Preliminary studies of the project demonstrate that: 1) cells actively pull on PD-1; 2) force on PD-1 elicits catch bonds to regulate ligand bonding; 3) force induces rearrangement of the PD-1–PD-L2 binding interface to form new atomic-level interactions; 4) mutating specific amino acids on PD-1 alters its force, catch bond and function; and 5) PD-1’s inhibitory signal suppresses antigen recognition by disrupting the synergy between TCR and CD8 in pMHC binding. These data support the hypothesis that force critically regulates ligand bonding and signaling of PD-1; as such, targeting the PD-1 mechanoregulation may represent a novel approach to immunotherapy. This hypothesis will be tested by three specific aims: 1) Determine the forces on PD-1 and their impact on PD-1 ligand bonding, signaling and function; 2) Modulate T cell function by targeting PD-1 mechanoregulation; and 3) Investigate the therapeutic potential of manipulating PD-1 catch bonds in tumor mouse models.

GrantView,CA250044,A physical sciences approach to investigate the role of exosomes in metastatic progression,CA250044,"Metastatic cancer is a major clinical challenge that accounts for numerous deaths annually in the United States, particularly in women with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Many tumors develop within a microenvironment (TME) characterized by altered/stiffened extracellular matrix (ECM) and compromised immunity. These alterations play a causal role in malignancy and metastasis. Recently tumor-derived exosomes have drawn tremendous interest as they are implicated in modulating the TME, suppressing anti-tumor immunity, and preparing the metastatic site for progression. A hallmark of cancer cells is their ability to evade the immune system. Exosomes play a pivotal role in the suppression of anti-tumor immunity. In this project, focusing on TNBC, we explore how ECM stiffness and cytoskeletal tension (collectively referred to as tissue tension) regulate exosome production and cargo composition, and how these exosomes contribute to the suppression of anti- tumor immunity and promote metastasis. We pursue a unique set of hypotheses linking tissue tension to exosome production and defining the role of tumor-derived exosomes in immune surveillance and metastatic progression. To test our hypotheses, we have assembled a strong team from UPENN and UCSF, integrating expertise in bioengineering, cancer mechanobiology, and cancer immunology. In Aim 1, we address whether and how the tissue tension affects exosome production and alters exosome cargo in vitro in TNBC cells. We will also delineate a molecular pathway linking ECM stiffness to intracellular signaling and exosome trafficking, using experimental and subcellular biophysical modeling methods. In Aim 2, we address how tissue tension promotes metastatic progression via exosomes in vivo. In this aim we test the hypothesis that the tension of the primary tumor tissue enhances exosome production and alters exosome cargo to promote the dissemination of primary tumor cells and foster their survival and outgrowth at the metastatic site. We will use unique genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) and syngeneic TNBC models, and TNBC patient PDXs, combined with multiscale pharmacokinetic modeling. In Aim 3, we address how tissue tension contributes to the suppression of anti-tumor immunity. In this aim, we will investigate the role of exosomes derived from tumors with high tension in stiff ECM TMEs in suppressing anti-tumor immunity through (1) reprogramming macrophages against T cells; and (2) the engagement of PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint axis in T cells. We will use a combination of in vitro cell culture experiments, in vivo genetically engineered mouse models and syngeneic transplant manipulations and tissue-scale agent-based modeling. The expected results will shed light on the roles of exosomes in immune regulation and metastatic tumor progression; these are important and timely questions in cancer research.

GrantView,CA250046,Information flow and state transitions at the system and multi-dimensional scales in leukemia progression,CA250046,"Cancer begins as a disease of the genome, with DNA mutations initiating a cascade of events that lead to cancer progression. As single or small collection of cells undergo state transitions to become cancer cells and ultimately evolve into a malignant neoplasm, the immune system is activated and new vasculature is formed, involving non-cancerous cells in the system. This process involves the flow and transfer of information across multiple scales in time and space. Information is encoded within and transferred between cells and across multiple genomic scales may be detected at the system’s level. Our hypothesis is that information contained in one or multiple genomic landscapes can be used to detect oncogenic perturbations and predict response to therapy. It has been shown that mutations associated with AML can be detected years before the onset of disease, however, they do not predict when the disease will manifest or response to treatment. Nevertheless, these sets of mutations can be characterized by distinct gene expression signatures collectively representing perturbations underlying the observed clinical phenotypes. Our approach aims to 1) make use of the maximum amount of relevant information in the system 2) be simple and parsimonious with the data, and 3) provide insight and predictions. We propose to validate a mathematical model and approach that considers genome-wide gene activity as state transition from a healthy state to a cancer state from the perspectives of messenger RNAs (mRNAs; transcriptome), non-coding microRNA (miRNAs; the miRome), and DNA methylation (epigenome).The theory and mathematics of state transitions is well known in the systems biology community and is a powerful tool for interpreting and predicting the behavior of complex systems such as genomics and cancer biology. The central hypothesis of this project is that information produced during a biological process such as cancer, can be detected from different viewpoints (i.e., transcriptome, miRome, epigenome) such that information contained in one viewpoint of the genomic landscape can be mapped into another, and that disease development and progression can be interpreted and predicted with mathematical models of information flow in a multidimensional genomic space. We will pursue the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Parameterize a mathematical model of multi-dimensional state transition. Specific Aim 2. Quantify the impact of treatment on state transition dynamics and develop a model of therapy response and relapse in a controlled AML mouse model. Specific Aim 3.

However, our inability to explain why some patients do not respond to immunotherapy, combined with our inability to identify early response or predict the responders, poses serious challenges in this field. Currently, biopsies serve as the most informative way to assess the immunological activity within a cancerous area, but we are spatially and temporally limited in the number of biopsies we can obtain from patients, especially in cases of brain cancer. Clear evidence of tumor-immune environment heterogeneity across patients suggests that we will have to use an individualized approach in order to accurately assess patient tumor’s specific immune environment and the evolution of these complex systems. We propose to use computational modeling and artificial intelligence to bridge the spatial scales of the cellular content comprising each MRI at the voxel level, but also to bridge the temporal scales. We will focus on the most cellular immune population in glioblastoma, microglia/macrophages, that constitute as much as 50% of the cellular content of tumor specimens. By fusing MRI with the biological heterogeneity found in image- localized biopsies through such radiomics approaches provides an opportunity to individualize our understanding of the the tumor-immune environment, broadly benefiting scientists across the fields of oncology and immunology. In addition to providing a deeper understanding of the tumor at every imaging time point, the radiomics maps can also be used to parameterize dynamic mechanistic models of tumor growth to allow for prediction of future dynamics.

Cutaneous melanoma can be successfully treated through surgical excision; however, once the disease has metastasized, the survival rate is significantly reduced. Some recent studies have suggested that in certain contexts, cues from the tumor microenvironment can epigenetically reprogram melanoma cells into a malignant melanoma initiating cell (MIC) that is drug resistant and primed for invasion and metastasis. In the Kilian laboratory we have discovered a relationship between tumor topology and activation of a tumorigenic MIC that may prove an early transformation step preceding metastasis. In the Copland laboratory, we have developed novel combination therapies to treat melanoma, and several patient derived tumor xenograft (PDTX) models that accurately mimic patient response to standard of care. We will employ our suite of engineered extracellular matrices to decipher the interplay between topology, mechanics and matrix composition, in guiding activation of the MIC state in patient derived cells that display varying degrees of drug sensitivity. We will translate these matrix parameters into a novel 3D geometrically structured tissue engineered microtumor model. To evaluate the potential as a tool for drug development we will fabricate a 96-well plate- based format and evaluate microtumor response to standard of care and prospective new therapies. We will use orthotopic xenografts in athymic nude mice to study growth, invasion and dissemination of our cells, and use this information to inform the design of our model 3D tumor-mimics. Towards leveraging our microtumor array for therapeutic development, we will perform a small pilot study of combination therapies using our tumor-mimics— in vitro and as a novel in vivo microtumor xenograft—to discern how closely our biomimetic system recapitulates oncogenesis and drug sensitivity compared to cell lines and xenografts.

Tumors can still engage multiple mechanisms to avoid and escape anti-tumor immune responses, including suppression, inactivation, and exclusion of potential cytotoxic T cells, processes which collaborate with cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). A better understanding of these barriers has led to a multitude of new immunomodulatory targets to be developed, some to be used in combination with e.g., checkpoint blockade or CAR T cells. On the other hand, dominant barriers to immunotherapy can be different among patients with the same cancer type, and thus there is a need for personalized approaches to immunotherapy, so that the appropriate targets are used. Here we develop a novel organotypic culture devices to maintain ex vivo cultures of primary tumors and an immune component (tumor-draining lymph nodes or circulating leukocytes), on a platform that enables precise control over spatial, molecular, cellular, and mechanical characteristics and that is relatively high-throughput to allow screening or large numbers of experimental variables. In preliminary data, we show that these devices mirror key features of in vivo responses to immunotherapy, such as improved tumor cell killing and increased markers of immunotoxicity (possible adverse events) in response to cytokine immunotherapy. We propose that these devices can be used both to screen for ideal immunotherapy combinations as well as to probe the basic mechanisms underlying the deficiencies in the anti-tumor immune response for tumors exhibiting varying levels of immune infiltration, neoantigen load, and baseline lymphatic densities. In this way, we can begin to build a stratification map that aligns key morphological features of individual tumors to treatment regimes that are most likely to lead to efficacy and tumor regression. Using a combination of both murine mouse models and primary patient-derived biospecimens, we will take advantage of the level of control afforded by our novel organotypic devices to mechanistically interrogate individual immune cell subsets and signaling axes, towards understanding their roles in influencing the course and outcomes of anti-tumor immune responses.",R01,"Tumor-Immune, Microenvironment, Platform Development, Immunotherapy",University of Chicago,UChicago,Melody Swartz,TEC,8/1/21,7/31/26,https://reporter.nih.gov/search/e_Rs-9eJQk-1Rn2vXtESMg/projects,4,,https://www.synapse.org/#!Team:3471149,https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn35270480,cfbd53dc-95b8-4ead-b468-e21c065ac14b,syn53259587

The team will test the hypothesis that tumor ecosystems rapidly adapt to stress engendered by therapies, leading to the rapid emergence of resistance. As a corollary, blocking adaptive responses in tumor cells and the immune microenvironment will interdict the emergence of resistance. The objective is to monitor mechanisms underlying adaptive responses across temporal and spatial scales with single-cell precision, predict responses to untested combinatorial perturbations, and validate predicted drug combinations, fueling future clinical trials. An interactive team with diverse and complementary expertise and long collaboration history has been assembled: cancer and systems biology and therapeutics (Mills, contact PI, OHSU), computational biology/image analysis (Korkut, PI, MDACC; Goecks, OHSU), bioinformatics and systems biology (Liang, PI, MDACC), single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics (Mohammed, OHSU), molecular and anatomic pathology (Corless, OHSU; Sahin, MDACC), and ovarian and breast cancer translational research (Westin, MDACC; Mitri, OHSU). We will pursue two specific aims. Aim 1. Develop novel algorithms to create mechanistic maps of adaptive responses to therapeutic stress. The team will innovate algorithms to build data-driven and predictive models encompassing tumor cell signaling, microenvironment, and immune modulation. An extensive pre-existing longitudinal proteomics dataset of cell lines, xenografts, novel murine transplantable syngeneic models, PDXs, and patient samples will serve as the experimental data and constraints driving model construction. The modeling approaches will identify cellular vulnerabilities arising from adaptive responses to therapeutic stress and predict responses to untested combinatorial perturbations. The team will also determine whether therapeutic targeting “steers” proteomically heterogeneous tumors to a more therapeutically tractable homogenous state. For this purpose, we will use state- of-the-art multiplexed imaging-based proteomics technologies to formulate and implement data-driven models at spatial and single-cell precision. The single-cell, data-driven modeling will demonstrate how targeted therapies alter the tumor and immune microenvironment, leading to therapeutic vulnerabilities that new targeted therapy or immunotherapy combinations could exploit.

While standard-of-care treatment and chemotherapy is effective in many TNBC patients, approximately 40% of patients display resistance, leading to poor overall survival. TNBC are characterized by significant intratumor heterogeneity, which further complicates treatment. Mechanisms of chemoresistance in TNBC patients remain poorly understood, in part due to a lack of available methods and models to measure intratumor heterogeneity and track changes in heterogeneous tumor compositions over time. Here we propose to use a new technology to track individual cells and clones as they respond to different chemotherapeutic agents; this more detailed information about the tumor cell population will be used to build mathematical models better predict and optimize therapeutic response. We first measure individual cell gene expression changes in response to treatment and then assemble these measurements into cell subpopulation trajectories, taking advantage of a barcoding technology developed in our lab to quantify clonally-resolved single cell transcriptomes. These Aim 1 studies will build a compendium of gene expression, cell growth and survival data that describes how each of the heterogeneous cells in major experimental models of subtypes of triple negative breast cancer responds to clinically-relevant therapeutic agents. The new ability to layer clonal identifier information on single cell gene expression data reveals the detailed trajectories of individual cells that escape therapy. It also distinguishes subpopulations with pre-existing treatment resistance from those in which a resistant state is induced. At a higher conceptual level, this proposal seeks to also address a broad practical challenge: the high-dimensional ‘omics’ data collected in many large-scale efforts points often points to correlations in disease progression but not been informative for building mechanistic models to aid in the predictive of tumor response. Often, other types of data are more readily available-- lower dimensional data with more frequent measurements. We therefore next ask: How can these distinct data types be integrated into a useful framework to build predictive models of tumor cell response to therapy? This seems a fitting goal for the systems biology of cancer community. We propose to tackle this challenge with our barcode tracking technology; relative fractions of sensitive and resistance phenotypes, along with separate longitudinal measurements of cell number (low dimension data), become the inputs for a mechanistic model to predict therapeutic response and resistance (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we will perform trajectory-mapping and model testing using patient-derived triple negative breast cancer cells, towards understanding the potential for translational utility. By integrating different data types into a cohesive framework, we aim to describe how sensitive and resistant subpopulations in TNBC grow, die, and transition in response to treatment.",U01,"Drug Resistance/Sensitivity, Heterogeneity",University of Texas at Austin,UT Austin,"Amy Brock, Thomas E.

GrantView,CA253547,Identifying therapeutic pathways targeting medulloblastoma-immune cell interactions,CA253547,"We propose developing a systems-biology approach to understand interactions between tumor and immune cells and their clinical implications. Our work will focus on medulloblastoma, a malignant pediatric brain tumor in which our team has extensive expertise. We and others have shown that medulloblastoma tumors are sites of immune activity despite the blood-brain barrier. However, the clinical consequences of these immune cells are unclear and there is little information that might guide development of therapeutics that modulate these immune cells. Our innovative strategy combines single-cell methods, including single-cell proteomics, with a sophisticated computational analysis. In Aim 1, we map the landscape of tumor-immune interactions using sequencing and imaging methods on human samples. Aim 2 builds a causal model of the molecular interactions that govern interactions among cell types in medulloblastoma, determines the clinical correlates of these cells, and identifies potential therapeutic targets. Aim 3 maps the tumor-immune environment in well-validated mouse models of the disease, and builds computational models for mice parallel to those for humans. Hypotheses from Aim 2 that are likely to translate well to the mouse models are then tested for their effects on tumor growth and survival. The mouse results are used to update the computational models and refine the therapeutic strategies. We expect that successful completion of this project will have a substantial impact on medulloblastoma therapeutics.

GrantView,CA253553,Spatiotemporal modeling of cancer-niche interactions in breast cancer bone metastasis,CA253553,"About 20-40% of breast cancer patients develop metastasis to the bone, years to even decades after surgical removal of primary tumors. Little is known about the biology of the latent, microscopic bone metastases before they outgrow to overt osteolytic macrometastases. This represents a significant gap in our understanding of bone metastasis. Targeting cancer cells that have not fully adapted to the bone microenvironment might provide therapeutic benefit and prevent the occurrence of overt metastases. Bone and bone marrow comprise of several highly distinctive microenvironment niches. Dormant, single disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) reside in the perivascular niche, whereas proliferative, multi-cell bone micrometastases (BMMs) are found in the osteogenic niche that exhibits features of active osteogenesis. Mechanisms through which the transition of different niches occurs to switch fates of metastatic seeds remain elusive. The overall objectives of this project are to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics, the molecular crosstalk, and the therapeutic targets underlying the interaction between breast cancer cells and different microenvironment niches in bone. We will pursue three specific aims. First, we will dissect the spatiotemporal dynamics of the perivascular and osteogenic niches and the cancer-niche interactions in bone micrometastasis models. We will use high-resolution, whole bone, multi photon microscopy and laser-captured microdissection (LCM) followed by transcriptome profiling (LCM-seq) to obtain relative localization and mutual impacts between cancer cells and niche cells in situ. Second, we will integrate transcriptomic and imaging data and develop computational models for discovery of new mechanisms and therapies toward blockade of cancer-niche interactions. Established and new algorithms will be used to uncover the microenvironment molecules, and autocrine and paracrine signaling pathways mediating niche-tumor interactions. Drug-repurposing analyses will be carried out to identify potential therapies that have already been used for other diseases. We will achieve a systematic understanding of early-stage bone colonization and generate testable mechanistic and therapeutic hypotheses. Third, we will validate the discovered mechanisms and predicted drug efficacies in animal models. The Zhang laboratory has adopted and established a series of genetically engineered mouse models and bone metastasis assays, which will be utilized to validate computational predictions generated by computational modeling by the Wong group. Both metastatic burden and frequency/distribution of DTCs and BMMs will be examined as endpoints. This study will unbiasedly profile the molecular process of early stage metastasis progression in the bone from DTCs to BMMs at single-to-few cell resolutions. This knowledge is unprecedented and critical for the ultimate understanding of metastasis latency, a long-standing clinical challenge. The modeling tool developed through this study will likely be applicable to other biological contexts involving highly spatiotemporally specific cancer niche interaction.

GrantView,CA254200,Bioengineered Prostate-on-Chip: Mechanisms of Stromal Dysregulation in Prostate Cancer,CA254200,"It is well accepted that intrinsic action of the androgen receptor (AR) within the prostate epithelium drives prostate cancer proliferation and survival. Less appreciated is the fact that AR is also expressed in the stroma surrounding the epithelium. Stromal-expressed AR acts extrinsically to maintain the differentiated striated basal and luminal epithelium of the normal gland. During prostate cancer development, AR expression in the stroma is lost. How AR is lost from the stroma and how its loss promotes prostate cancer development is unknown. Our objectives are to define the mechanism that leads to stromal-specific AR loss and determine how AR loss in the stroma, in conjunction with epithelial oncogenesis, promotes prostate cancer development Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that tumor-derived TNFα/TGFβ1 transcriptionally suppresses AR expression in the stroma, causing loss of FGF10 and Wnt16 secretion, which are required to maintain the stratified epithelium through induction of luminal cells and maintenance of basal cells, respectively. To test this, we developed the first human Prostate-on-Chip model by culturing basal epithelial cells next to prostate stromal cells within a microfluidic device. Within this model, we can fully recapitulate the stromal AR-dependent induction of luminal epithelial cell differentiation. Furthermore, co-culturing normal stroma with tumor cells within this model leads to the induction of CAF phenotypes and reduced stromal AR expression, mimicking the tumor/host interactions seen in vivo. Models that recapitulate human glandular organization and its dysregulation during disease development are critical for our mechanistic understanding of how stroma and oncogenic epithelial interactions drive tumor development. We will test our hypothesis in three aims: 1) Determine the mechanism by which stromal AR maintains prostate epithelial cell differentiation. Our working hypothesis is that stromal AR signaling induces secretion of stromal FGF10 and Wnt16, which are required for induction of luminal epithelial cells and maintenance of basal epithelial cells, respectively. 2) Determine the mechanism by which AR expression is lost in the tumor stroma. Our working hypothesis is that tumor-secreted factors, TNFα and TGFβ1, acting through NF-κB signaling, suppress transcription of the stromal AR gene independent of CAF conversion. 3) Determine the functional consequence of tumor-induced stromal AR loss on prostate epithelial differentiation in a new de novo in situ human prostate cancer model. Our working hypothesis is that tumor-induced stromal loss of AR- dependent induction of Wnt16 and FGF10, via TNFα/TGFβ1, co-operates with epithelial oncogenes to accelerate tumor development and induce loss of basal epithelial cells. The proposed studies will be the first to demonstrate how TNFα/TGFβ-mediated suppression of stromal AR expression leads to the loss of Wnt16 and FGF10 to promote prostate cancer development. These studies will also provide the framework for further development of the first human Prostate-on-Chip model, which recapitulates human prostate biology, for basic and translation cancer research.",R01,"Platform Development, Microenvironment",University of Arizona,UA,"Cynthia Miranti, Yitshak Zohar",TEC,4/7/21,3/31/26,https://reporter.nih.gov/search/Ha-ZvrWB6UyTdUcSXOYe2g/projects,4,,https://www.synapse.org/#!Team:3471148,https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn35270475,be179a4f-f228-40b9-b1af-9afd90b0dd26,syn53259587
GrantView,CA254886,Live cell reporters of genetic changes in stiff vs soft surroundings - Causes & Consequences,CA254886,"Live cell reporters of genetic changes in stiff vs soft surroundings – causes & consequences Solid tumors are often palpably stiff and more constrained in 3D growth than ‘liquid’ hematopoietic tumors. Extensive sequencing of dozens of cancer types further indicates that solid tumors within stiff tissues exhibit many more genetic changes than liquid and soft-tissue tumors [Pfeifer 2017]. Our first hypothesis is a mechano-genetics hypothesis, namely genetic changes are caused in part by the mechanics of the tumor or tissue micro-environment. A key limitation of current sequencing methods is that they require killing cells to isolate the DNA, which prevents tracking a cell before, during, and after a genetic change. A new method is needed to track genetic changes in living cells under diverse biophysical stresses. Our second hypothesis is that gene editing can be used to enable tracking some changes in the genetics of single cells in real-time. Preliminary results from a new approach already support both hypotheses. RFP (red fluorescent protein) is fused to a single allele of an abundant constitutive gene in cancer cells or normal cells. For appropriate genes, we find that RFP-neg cells have lost all or part of the edited chromosome, using methods that range from single cell DNA-seq to allele-specific PCR. For the one edited chromosome that has been studied most deeply (of three), the RFP-neg cells divide and pass on the genetic change, and they also exhibit a ‘go-and-grow’ phenotype consistent with partial loss of a key tumor suppressor. In solid tumor xenografts that start with freshly sorted RFP-pos cells, the fraction of RFP-neg cells scales strongly with the number of cell divisions, unlike 2D cultures, and 3D imaging further shows that (i) dividing cells are flattened in vivo, and (ii) interphase nuclei with high curvature tend to rupture and exhibit high DNA damage. In reductionist 3D culture studies, confinement and constriction likewise increase GFP-neg cell numbers. The preliminary results directly support our mechano-genetics hypothesis. We will replicate and extend our preliminary results both in vitro and in vivo with the ultimate goals of identifying mechanically modulated pathways of chromosome loss and consequences for phenotype. For relevance to patients, the in vivo studies will include liver cancer patient derived xenografts (PDX) that are gene edited and grown in liver as well as softer and stiffer sites.",U01,Mechano-genetics,University of Pennsylvania,UPenn,Denis E.

GrantView,CA256054,Enabling Technology to Study Mechanosensitive and Mechanoresistant Cancer Cells in Flow,CA256054,"Mechanotransduction of cancer cells in the solid tumor environment is an active area of research, yet far less work has been done to examine the biological behavior of cancer cells in the blood flow environment. Recently, mechanical stimuli such as shear stress have received attention for their effects on cancer progression. For instance, studies have shown that shear stress has been associated with enhanced metastasis and cancer cell death. In the applicant’s laboratory, the synergistic effect of shear stress on tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) was demonstrated, as well as the unique ability of cancer cells to survive extremely high pulses of shear stress, comparable to blood cells. These mechanical cues can be translated into biochemical responses in cells through the process of mechanotransduction. It is proposed to subject cell suspensions to repeated shear stress pulses in a multiwell plate format to study shear stress response and to develop “mechanoresistant” cell lines that will be phenotypically and genotypically characterized with the goal of identifying the drivers that enable cancer cells to survive in circulation. Moreover, given that the presence of CTC aggregates in the blood signal more aggressive and metastatic disease, multicellular aggregates modeled after aggregates isolated and characterized from prostate cancer patient blood samples will be tested in vitro for their mechanical responses, and also used to guide the development of model cells and spheroids to be injected into experimental mouse models of bloodborne metastasis. This research is organized around three specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To develop a new high throughput device to study the effect of fluid shear stress on cancer cell responses. A multiwell plate configuration based on a BioJet printer will enable direct analysis with multiwell plate-capable flow cytometers and spectrophotometers. Calcium influx, membrane and mitochondrial damage, and apoptosis of cancer cells in response to shear stress signals will be examined, and “mechanoresistant” prostate cancer cells developed and characterized. Specific Aim 2: To develop the shear flow device and culture conditions to study shear stress responses modulated by interactions with stromal cells. Circulating tumor cell aggregates isolated from prostate cancer patient blood samples will be characterized, and used to develop model aggregates for further study. The stability and survival of heterogeneous tumor cell aggregates in shear flow will then be studied. Specific Aim 3: To examine the roles of cancer cell mechanosensitization and mechanoresistance on metastatic tumor burden in vivo. Orthotopic metastasis studies using cells with modulated shear sensitivity will be performed. Mechanoresistant cancer cells vs. parental cancer cells will be compared in an experimental mouse model of metastasis, and the fate of injected cell aggregates studied as well.",R01,"Mechano-resistance, Metastasis, Platform Development",Vanderbilt University,Vanderbilt,Michael King,TEC,8/1/21,7/31/26,https://reporter.nih.gov/search/E_R41eTp4EKxqCGxtzBQCQ/projects,4,,https://www.synapse.org/#!Team:3471154,https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn35270508,bff06e16-b227-4d77-9b12-f2e99892c832,syn53259587
GrantView,CA256481,Perivascular Tissue Models to Overcome MGMT-Mediated Temozolomide Resistance in Glioblastoma,CA256481,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal form of brain cancer. Standard of care is surgical resection followed by treatment with the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ). However, two major challenges make GBM currently untreatable: 1) its diffuse invasion beyond the surgical margin; and 2) TMZ resistance that is tightly linked to expression of the DNA damage repair protein MGMT. While perivascular niches (PVNs) extending from the tumor into the surrounding parenchyma are believed to regulate invasion, recurrence, and poor survival, the majority of animal glioma models are sensitive to TMZ and most do not express MGMT, making it difficult to assess novel therapeutics in animal models that don’t display TMZ resistance. This Cancer Tissue Engineering Collaborative project will develop and thoroughly characterize a multidimensional engineered PVN biomaterial, study pathophysiological processes driving GBM invasion and TMZ resistance, and accelerate the evaluation of novel TMZ derivatives created to target diffuse GBM cells regardless of MGMT status. We will use advanced microfluidics to create libraries of miniaturized gelatin hydrogels containing margin-mimetic hyaluronic acid (HA) and an embedded perivascular network. We also use a novel synthetic pipeline to create TMZ derivatives that generate alternate DNA modifications that cannot be removed by MGMT that we hypothesize work in an MGMT- independent fashion. Merging these technologies, we will benchmark an engineered PVN platform formed using primary brain neurovascular cells for rapid evaluation of GBM invasion, MGMT expression, and TMZ resistance amenable to analysis of cell lines and patient-derived GBM specimens with disparate MGMT profiles. To do this, we will first construct and thoroughly characterize an engineered perivascular niche (Aim 1). We will use this novel biomaterial to benchmark patterns of invasion and MGMT expression in GBM cell lines (Aim 2). Finally, we will establish predictive efficacy of TMZ variants in an engineered perivascular niche (Aim 3). Together, we will develop, characterize, and benchmark a tissue engineered PVN to examine the role of microenvironmental selection pressures in the tumor margin on behaviors related to invasion, MGMT-mediated TMZ resistance, recurrence, and poor survival. Consistent with score-driving criteria of the CTEC program, we will develop and thoroughly characterize an engineered PVN biomaterial, show it fits within the continuum of existing cancer models, use it to examine phenomena underlying the failure to achieve durable survival, and gain actionable insight regarding novel TMZ derivatives with potential to effectively target GBM cells in the margins independent of MGMT status.",R01,"Drug Resistance/Sensitivity, Metastasis, Platform Development",University of Illinois,University of Illinois,Brendan Harley,TEC,12/1/20,11/30/25,https://reporter.nih.gov/search/fXJsj5oMCEWGAvQaTHtGeQ/projects,4,,https://www.synapse.org/#!Team:3471150,https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn35270485,3a2e5371-1b97-434f-9715-219f7b909a9a,syn53259587
GrantView,CA260432,Identification and characterization of cancer cell states by novel computational and experimental technologies,CA260432,"Tumors are complex systems composed of genetically and transcriptionally heterogeneous cells, and this heterogeneity has been implicated as a cause of drug resistance and overall mortality. Understanding intra- tumor heterogeneity is therefore likely to have widespread impact, both fundamental and clinical. The advent of single-cell RNA-Seq has led to the detection of transcriptionally distinct states among cancer cells across a wide range of tumor types and stages. However, the field lacks robust computational and experimental technologies to functionally identify and characterize these cancer cell states. In this project, we take a gene module-centric view to define cell states in a rigorous and widely applicable manner. We will validate the importance of each cell state using human samples and the zebrafish melanoma model, which has exceptional capabilities for imaging and perturbation of cell states throughout tumor progression and metastasis. To systematically characterize these cell states experimentally, we propose methods to assay their interdependencies within the tumor and with elements of the microenvironment. Our genetically engineered zebrafish will mark each cancer cell state with a fluorescent reporter and an ablation cassette, providing a flexible experimental platform to study and perturb each cell state. The reporter will enable us to sort cancer cell states and study them individually, with a particular emphasis on their plasticity. By systematically disrupting cancer cell states, we will further elucidate their individual contributions to tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. Using a spatial transcriptomics approach and integrating with single-cell RNA-seq data, we will map cancer cell states in relation to their microenvironment to screen for putative interactions. Finally, we will directly test predicted interactions between specific cancer cell states and the immune compartment using T cell-deficient fish.

Understanding of the fundamental mechanisms leading to metastatic cancer has been hampered by the need for models that replicate the step- wise metastatic process in vivo, yet are amenable to tight control and facilitate high-resolution, time-lapse imaging and quantitative analysis of cell behavior. Over the past decade, our team has developed in vivo and in vitro methods capable of simulating many steps of the metastatic cascade including tumor cell invasion, intravasation, trapping in the microcirculation or adhesion to the vessel walls, and extravasation into the surrounding extracellular matrix. In parallel, we have developed computational studies that provided detailed insights often not possible through experiments. This collective prior work has shed new light on central aspects of single-cell and collective cell behavior during metastasis, and identified mechanical adaptations and vulnerabilities of the tumor cell with promise for targeted interventions. The goal of our proposed U54 Center is to employ these developed assays and methods in combination with new measurement techniques to interrogate the full spectrum of stressors experienced by tumor cells in the metastatic niche during arrest and extravasation, and couple these with parallel studies of changes in chromatin structure and the transcriptome of tumor cells (Core B). These changes are critical to mechano-adaptation of the tumor cells towards an organ-preferential initiation of a metastatic colony or transition to dormancy. A hallmark of our proposed center is the use of state- of-the-art in vitro (Project 1) and in vivo (Project 2) experiments and computation (Core A) to uncover and probe the factors that ultimately determine tumor cell fate.

As such, these cellular interactions likely shape metastatic progression, responses to therapy and metastatic dissemination. However, we have a limited understanding of how these components coordinately regulate metastatic progression. This application describes a series of highly innovative multidisciplinary molecular, cell- biological, metabolic, massively-parallel single-cell sequencing and organismal methods applied towards defining the dynamic and emergent mechanisms by which neural cells, lymphatics, immune cells and metabolites interact to coordinately regulate metastatic progression—contributing to a systems-level understanding of metastasis. We aim to (i) define the role of neural innervation on metastatic progression by characterizing neuro- tumor and neuro-immune interactions and identifying neural signals and their pro-metastatic mechanisms of action, (ii) determine how endothelial cells regulate innervation of metastatic tumors, (iii) define the role of regionalized lymphatic interactions in driving metastatic progression and anti-metastatic immunity, (iv) assess the role of neuro-immune and neuro-epithelial interactions on early metastatic dissemination and colonization, (v) identify metabolite and protein signals that drive metastatic colonization, (vi) discover tumoral transcription factors and RNA-binding proteins that act downstream of neural and metabolic signals to drive emergent pro- metastatic gene expression programs, and (vii) determine the impact of standard chemotherapy on these diverse cellular interactions and metabolic determinants of metastatic progression.

Specifically, with Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by Time of Flight (MIBI-TOF) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization imaging (MALDI) we simultaneously visualize the composition, lineage, function and spatial distribution of tumor and stromal cell populations and perform co-registered analysis of the glycome. We integrate these data within the genomic landscape of metastatic disease and analyze these data within robust machine learning and computational frameworks to uncover disease dynamics and features associated with clinical outcomes. Lastly, we conduct genome-scale CRISPR screens in 3D breast cancer models to systematically define oncogenic dependencies, therapeutic vulnerabilities and macrophage-tumor cell interactions.

GrantView,CA261822,A transdisciplinary approach for dissecting stem cell states in prostate cancer,CA261822,"Understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive prostate cancer progression has profound significance for defining the biology of lethal prostate cancer. The cancer stem cell model proposes that cells within a tumor are organized in a hierarchical lineage relationship and display different tumorigenic potential. This model has important translational implications since it suggests that effective therapeutics should target cancer stem cells that sustain tumor malignancy. However, despite intensive investigation, long-standing questions about the existence and properties of prostate cancer stem cells remain unresolved. To identify, characterize, and therapeutically target this population, we will combine the expertise of cancer stem cell researchers with computational/mathematical approaches. Leveraging techniques from theoretical physics (Random Matrix Theory) and algebraic topology (Topological Data Analysis), we will provide a statistical framework to dissect a molecular signature (termed CasPro) implicated in progenitor activity in prostate tumors. We will experimentally validate our findings by investigating CasPro-high cells in genetically-engineered mouse models of prostate cancer and analyzing their functional properties in assays of stem cell activities. These findings will then be further validated in studies of human prostate tumor samples, particularly from patients with treatment-resistant castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In the longer-term, we anticipate that our studies of key regulators of the stem cell signature as well as the epigenomic landscape of CasPro-high cells will identify novel targets for therapy, and lead to novel candidate drugs for these targets.

GrantView,CA261841,Ecology and Evolution of Breast Carcinogenesis,CA261841,"In early breast carcinogenesis, neoplastic cells grow in multiple layers towards the lumens of ducts, which subjects the periluminal cells to harsh conditions of low oxygen, low pH, and nutrient deprivation. Adaptation to these harsh conditions is a pre-requisite for survival of incipient tumor cells. Adaptations are initially acute and reversible, but eventually Darwinian selection results in cells with hardwired phenotypes. A prominent example of this is aerobic glycolysis, or the Warburg Effect (WE), wherein cells are hard-wired to ferment glucose, even in the presence of oxygen. Notably, a WE is highly correlated with a cancer’s metastatic potential and poor outcome. Hence, a major question in carcinogenesis is: “What are the mechanisms by which a harsh microenvironment eventually selects for hard-wired (heritable) phenotypes, such as a WE?”. Rather than simply selection of pre-existing phenotypes, we contend that the microenvironment actively induces phenotypic diversity through a systematic set of epigenetic and genetic alterations. To address this question, we combine preliminary data from three different approaches that are all focused on the eco-evolutionary dynamics occurring during carcinogenesis: In the first, we have subjected benign breast cancer and epithelial cells to harsh conditions encountered in DCIS and have observed that the cells that survive these selections exhibit a WE. We selected three clones and applied single cell RNA sequencing and single cell ATAQ sequencing as well as whole exome sequencing to map the transcriptome, epigenome, and mutation patterns of the selected clones compared to their parental normal cells. This will form the model system to be analyzed throughout the current proposal. In the second line of investigation, we have documented the profound epigenetic changes that occur during progression of multiple myeloma (MM) from pre-malignant to metabolically active disease. We hypothesize that these observations in MM can provide a framework to predict and interpret the changes that breast cancer cells undergo as they transition from a benign non-glycolytic to an aggressive glycolytic state. In the third line of investigation, we have outlined a continuum starting with epigenetic changes and show how these result in permanent mutational or chromosomal changes. This latter work provides a framework with which to predict and interpret how microenvironment-induced epigenetic changes can eventually lead to hardwired genetic changes that are observed in aggressive glycolytic breast cancer. By combining these approaches, we propose to decipher the mechanisms whereby microenvironmental stress-induced genome evolution results in hard-wired phenotypic adaptations, represented by a WE. At the end this study, we expect to have a more complete and comprehensive understanding of the environmentally-induced epigenetic and genetic changes that occur during carcinogenesis, and how these relate to hard-wired phenotypic profiles, as exemplified by the Warburg Effect.",U01,Microenvironment,Stony Brook University,SBU,Mehdi Damaghi,PS-ON,9/15/21,8/31/26,https://reporter.nih.gov/search/ubdek5RurEip3PqsOWvpqA/projects,4,,https://www.synapse.org/#!Team:3471143,https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn32406006,f96bf66b-62f1-44f4-92a9-b78cebef121c,syn53259587
GrantView,CA261842,Targeting physical stress-driven mechanisms to overcome glioblastoma treatment resistance,CA261842,"Patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) have poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Immune checkpoint therapies, which have shown dramatic benefits in other cancers, have failed to improve outcomes in GBM patients in all randomized phase III trials. Brain tumors generate mechanical forces as they grow in the confined space of the cranium, and we have shown that these physical forces affect cell viability and phenotype (Nature Biotechnology 1997, PNAS 2012, Nature Biomedical Engineering 2016, 2019, Science 2020). Our preliminary results indicate that compressive forces similar to those in brain tumors are sufficient to upregulate stress granule protein G3BP2 as well as genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), stemness and the immune checkpoints. Furthermore, we have shown G3BP2 regulates cancer cell stemness in breast cancer (PNAS 2017). Thus, we hypothesize that mechanical stresses in the GBM environment contribute to GBM stemness and immunosuppression, and that the pathways involved can be targeted to enhance tumor killing. In this project, we will dissect the stress-induced pathways involved in mechanical regulation of stemness and immunosuppression in GBM. We will then block these pathways in orthotopic, immunocompetent mouse models of GBM to enhance immunotherapy.

GrantView,CA263001,The Center for Systems Knowledge in Melanoma Metastasis (SKIMM),CA263001,"Conventional views of cancer as a predominantly genetic disease that proceeds in a step-wise, linear manner, have ceded to an understanding that tumor progression involves a multifaceted set of tumor cell-intrinsic and micro-environmental adaptations that co-evolve dynamically and non-linearly. However, much remains to be discovered about how different cell populations in the local environment drive metastatic behavior at different stages of tumor progression. Primary melanomas that are only millimeters thick can disseminate to lymph nodes and distant organs. This clinical feature suggests that egress of tumor cells from a primary site occurs early in melanoma development making melanoma an exceptional model to study these dynamic adaptations during the earliest stages of tumor progression. Our central hypothesis is that melanoma metastasis is driven by a combination of tumor cell‚Äìintrinsic features and interactions with micro-environmental compartments that govern early dissemination and immune evasion in the regional draining lymph nodes. To test this hypothesis, we propose three inter-related projects, supported by three cores that will collectively build an in- depth transcriptional and cellular map of critical compartments in the tumor microenvironment during early melanoma dissemination, in both mouse models and patient biospecimens. Successful completion of these projects will identify genes and transcriptional programs within those compartments that drive and maintain tumorigenic adaptations and ultimately metastatic dissemination. Our aims are to: 1. Map the cellular and molecular evolution of primary melanomas and their local and regional microenvironments to identify critical ‚Äòswitches‚Äô that drive non-linear tumor progression; 2. Mechanistically dissect the emergence and functional relevance of transcriptionally defined cell state heterogeneity of malignant and non-malignant cell populations; 3. Identify novel therapeutic vulnerabilities to intercept early dissemination, mobilize systemic immune surveillance, and improve patient outcomes; and 4. Leverage the information gained to define new biomarkers of melanoma metastasis. We expect that knowledge generated through our approach may define new biomarkers of melanoma metastasis and therapeutic strategies to manage early disease. Our approach can serve as a roadmap to study early tumor progression at an unprecedented level of cellular, spatial and temporal resolution. It will provide a comprehensive picture of interactions both within the tumor microenvironment and tumor draining lymph nodes that influence tumor cell behavior and condition the host to be receptive to metastatic spread. We will leverage the complementary and synergistic expertise of our research team with an established record of productive collaboration, our novel genetically engineered mouse model that recapitulates early progression of human melanoma, and our access to high quality, clinically annotated patient samples from over 4,700 patients enrolled in a prospective clinicopathological database.

GrantView,CA264583,Spatial and temporal tumor-immune co-evolution and interactions that model lung adenocarcinoma development,CA264583,"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most frequent subtype of lung cancer and accounts for most cancer deaths. Improved early detection has increased the number of LUADs diagnosed at earlier pathological stages, thus warranting strategies to treat this growing patient subpopulation. Thwarting these advances is a very poor understanding of early events that drive LUAD development and that thus would guide ideal approaches for interception. While normal lung epithelia of LUAD patients were shown to display tumor-pertinent molecular and inflammatory changes, it is not clear why a LUAD develops within a particular region in the lung. Whereas the lung is ecologically rich with many cell populations that partake in both physiological and pathological processes, we still do not know how the properties and roles of individual cell populations, such as epithelial and immune subsets, co-evolve and interact to instigate LUAD development from a specific niche in the lung. In our preliminary efforts, we found by multi-region single-cell sequencing remarkable evolution of the properties and transcriptomic features of multiple cell subsets and states (e.g., protumor immunosuppressive phenotypes) across macro-space, such that cellular ecosystems and immune cell receptor repertoires were more similar among LUADs and adjacent normal regions than with more distant normal sites. Also, such spatial properties were progressively enriched along the pathologic continuum of matched human normal lung, to preneoplasias, up to invasive LUADs. Our preliminary findings motivate the hypothesis that geospatially and temporally evolving expression programs, properties, and interplay of epithelial and immune cells model early development of LUAD from the normal and premalignant lung. In Aim 1, we will study LUADs and matched multi-region normal tissues with defined spatial proximities from the tumors by single-cell RNA and immune receptor sequencing in conjunction with analysis of mutations in the tumors to establish single-cell maps of LUAD and immune co-evolution in space. Spatially modulated cell properties and states will then be used to feed and train a machine learning model that portrays LUAD development from the lung ecosystem. In Aim 2, we will single-cell decode tumor-immune co-evolution along the pathologic continuum of normal and premalignant lung to LUAD as well as identify cell states and properties that are modulated by early immune intervention. We will use temporal information in mice, along with human matched normal lung tissues, preneoplastic lesions, and invasive LUADs, to iteratively validate and fine-tune the performance of our machine learning model to portray LUAD development in time from the normal and premalignant lung. At the end of our studies, we will have built new models that reliably portray LUAD evolution in space and time.

Despite the advances made in our understanding of the etiology of pT-ALL, the overall survival of this disease has not significantly improved. Children with recurrent T-ALL have a dismal survival rate of < 25%, and long-term survivors have an increased burden of disease associated with the curative chemotherapies they received. Therefore, novel targeted therapeutics in combinations are much needed. Population-based genomic and transcriptomic studies have revealed the inter-leukemia diversity of pT-ALL. However, very little is known about intra-leukemia clonal heterogeneity in pT-ALL that were known to contribute to drug resistance and disease recurrence. For example, it remains mysterious what molecular and cellular features of the rare clones have to allow them to survive treatment as other major clones are eliminated. T-ALL arises during the dynamic developmental processes and retains hallmarks of their cellular origins. However, it remains unclear how T-cell development contributes to clonal heterogeneity of pT-ALL. Moreover, whether cell–cell communications between cancer cells and normal cells in the tumor microenvironment contribute to disease recurrence is unclear. Using bulk systems pharmacology and single-cell systems biology approaches, we discovered the leukemia heterogeneity associated with T-cell maturation and drug sensitivity in single cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that clonal therapy by targeting signaling networks in clonal subpopulations arising from T-cell differentiation will minimize relapsed/refractory diseases and improve outcomes for pT-ALL. Our team at St. Jude is uniquely positioned to tackle these challenges, capitalizing on vast expertise in systems biology, ALL pharmacogenomics, and T-cell development. Specifically, in this proposal, we will determine how T-cell development contributes to the intra-leukemia heterogeneity in pT-ALL (Aim 1). We will map clones in pT-ALL to T-cell maturation stages by single-cell analyses of primary samples and normal developmental T cells. We will identify clone-specific hidden drivers that drive clonal heterogeneity and drug sensitivity. Next, we will identify drug combinations that target signaling drivers in multiple clones (Aim 2). We will integrate bulk systems pharmacology with single-cell hidden-driver analyses to unbiasedly predict synergistic drug combinations and validate them by drug screening. We will use patient-derived xenografts that retain clonal complexity for in vivo validation. We will also investigate how TME reprograming modulates clone selection with treatment in pT-ALL (Aim 3). We will reconstruct the tumor and TME communication network from scRNA-seq data and elucidate the molecular mechanisms of clonal selection with treatment in pT-ALL.

GrantView,CA264611,Systems analysis of mechanisms driving response to immunotherapy in clear cell cancers,CA264611,"Clear cell ovarian cancer (ccOC) is a rare and lethal cancer with few treatment options. Based on molecular analysis ccOC appears intrinsically immunogenic but with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, similar to other ovarian cancer types. However, ccOC is very distinct from high grade serous ovarian carcinoma. Strikingly, it is similar in gene expression profiles to more frequent clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC), suggesting that clear cell cancers share intrinsic mechanistic or microenvironment properties, not just morphological appearance. Around 25% of ccRCC respond well to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), but markers for predicting response are lacking. The objective response rate for monotherapy pembrolizumab in one study was 33.3% for ccOC patients; but, in general, it is unknown which clear cell cancer patients could benefit from ICI treatment. Recent work has shown that tumor behavior is driven not just by cellular composition, but also by the spatial organization of different cell types including immune and stromal cells, as well as malignant cells themselves. Knowledge of clear cell cancer tumor microenvironments and their spatial architecture is lacking. Addressing this gap will improve our understanding of mechanisms of response to ICIs in clear cell cancers, including rare ones like ccOC, and improve selection of patients for immunotherapy. This study will use systems biology approaches to (i) elucidate and compare the cell types and their transcriptional states present in ccOC and ccRCC; (ii) characterize the spatial architecture of these cells within tumors using the CODEX (CODetection by indEXing) single cell proteomic imaging platform; and (iii) model and validate cell-cell interactions in the spatial tumor microenvironment that drive clear cell cancer response to immunotherapy through extensions of causal signaling inference algorithms to incorporate spatial context, and to optimize experimental validations in mouse models that maximize the information gain about interaction networks. Similar intrinsic and tumor microenvironmental features shared by ccOC and ccRCC, will nominate common mechanisms of immunotherapy response, and identify the subset of both who might benefit from treatment with ICIs. Successful development and application of these methods to clear cell cancers will establish a framework that can be applied to other cancer types, notably to rare ones. The expected outcome of this proposal is a comprehensive definition and dissection of the tumor microenvironment of ccRCC and ccOC.

However, the value of this combination in potentially curable earlier stage patients is variable. Our preliminary results examined the evolutionary trajectories of early stage breast cancer tumors using single cell transcriptomic profiling of serial tumor biopsies from a clinical trial of preoperative endocrine therapy alone (letrozole) or in combination with the cell cycle inhibitor ribociclib. Resistant tumors with accelerated loss of estrogen signaling show up-regulation of the JNK pathway, while those that maintain estrogen signaling during therapy show potentiation of CDK4/6 activation consistent with ERBB4 and ERK signaling up-regulation. Cell cycle reconstruction identified that tumors cells can reactivate during combination treatment, indicating stronger selection for a proliferative state. We hypothesize that resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition in earlier stage breast cancer is driven by JNK MAPK pathway stimulation and reactivation of the cell cycle through promotion of CDK6 expression or decreased cell cycle inhibitor function. In Aim 1, we will use a new mechanistic model of CDK4/6 regulation by cell cycle Inhibitors and Promoters (CIP) that couples estrogen and JNK signaling with cell cycle progression to measure the mechanisms driving cell cycle activation in a series of isogenic cell lines sensitive and resistant to CDK4/6 and endocrine inhibitors and in patient tumor cells. This analysis will reveal how distinct signaling pathways contribute to cell cycle reactivation during estrogen, CDK4/6 and JNK inhibition treatments and provide signatures of each resistant mechanism across cell types, over time and between systems. Aim 2 leverages our collection of patient tumors from the FELINE clinical trial to discover the intracellular and intratumoral resistance mechanisms driving proliferation. Fundamental resistance mechanisms will be measured in over ~300,000 patient cells from 360 tumor samples using single cell RNA sequencing data already in hand to identify core intracellular signaling states that act alone or in concert to drive proliferation. Next, the population of cells within each tumor will be analyzed to quantify intratumoral heterogeneity and how resistant populations differ in growing or shrinking tumors during drug treatment. Applying CIP to project proliferation across patient tumor cells will allow prediction of inhibitor strategies that most effectively block intracellular and intratumoral proliferation. Lastly, Aim 3 will apply a series of JNK pathway drugs with clinical potential to design and test treatment strategies that maintain durable inhibition of proliferation in ER+ cancer cells. Iterative feedback between mathematical models and patient/experimental data serves to provide a deep understanding of cell cycle regulation and mechanisms of dysregulation leading to resistance.

Strong epidemiological evidence links certain types of human cancer, including CRC, with obesity, and the obese pathophysiological state has been shown experimentally to stimulate CRC tumor growth. However, the mechanisms involved are not fully known: in particular, the impact of the obese tumor microenvironment on CRC tumor cellular composition, stiffness, and ECM composition is not known. Further, pathophysiologically relevant, patient-specific models for investigating obesity-linked inflammation mediated changes in the obese, tumor microenvironment do not exist for CRC. Thus, the objective of the proposed project is to examine modulation of the tumor microenvironment and obesity-related CRC disease progression using tissue-engineered patient derived xenograft (PDX) CRC models validated through comparison to patient tumors and PDX tumors. Our collaborative team will achieve this objective by leveraging their unique combined interdisciplinary expertise in CRC, tissue engineering, obesity and metabolic disease, transcriptomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics. We will use our improved models of CRC that replicate the cues found in the obese, insulin resistant/pro- inflammatory tumor microenvironment to test the hypothesis that obesity alters stromal signaling in the consensus molecular subtype 4 (CMS4) tumor microenvironment. To test our hypothesis, we have developed a tissue-engineered platform that enables long-term in vitro culture of the patient-derived CRC cells and recapitulation of the native tumor microenvironment, particularly the stromal component.

Specifically, we will address two questions: 1) How does the intersection of shifts in cell-intrinsic and cell- extrinsic signals associated with shifts in expression of the membrane adaptor protein Caveolin-1 affect the metastatic propensity of pediatric sarcoma (Research Testbed Unit 1)? 2) What are the effects of cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic variation in lipid metabolism on melanoma metastasis patterns (Research Testbed Unit 2)? Answers to both questions depend on technology to capture the molecular, metabolic, and morphological states of individual metastatic cells as they colonize the distant site: In the Technology Development Unit-1 we will develop a multi-modal, multi-scale live imaging platform to investigate the effects of intersecting microenvironmental variation across an organism and cell intrinsic heterogeneity on metastatic spreading. The platform will leverage the exquisite optical and physiological properties of the zebrafish embryos to ‘watch’ at once how cells form human tumor xenografts spread to multiple distant sites where they form metastatic tumors. The microscope will allow seamless switching between a high-throughput screening mode observing the metastatic patterns in tens to hundreds of embryos in one experiment and a high-resolution imaging mode with fully isotropic resolution of 300 nm in XYZ that allows detailed analysis of the molecular, metabolic, morphologic, and proliferation/survival states of individual cells within an emerging metastatic niche. In the Technology Development Unit-2 we will develop a multi-scale imaging platform to investigate by hyper-spectral analysis the molecular, metabolic, morphological, and functional states of metastatic cells across entire mouse organs. The platform will leverage advances in tissue clearing, fully automated high-speed and high-resolution light-sheet fluorescence imaging, and computer vision, to integrate a mesoscopic imaging mode for fast acquisition of volumes of up to 20 x 20 x 20 mm at a ~5-10 micron isotropic resolution with a nanoscopic imaging mode providing 300 nm XYZ-resolution throughout a 300 micron field of view anywhere in the organ. Biological features can thus be rapidly identified and immediately interrogated with high subcellular resolution. We will then develop physically and chemically accelerated 60-plex cyclic immunofluorescence assays to comprehensively characterize the molecular, metabolic and architectural states of colonizing cells and their surroundings in the metastatic niche in thick (~200 microns) tissue sections.

GrantView,CA268083,Center for 3D Imaging in Cancer Cell Biology,CA268083,"The mortality rates of breast and pancreatic cancers are intrinsically tied to metastasis. In pancreatic cancer, the 5-year survival rate is only 9% and in ~70% pathological evaluations of the resected tumor, instances of venous invasion are found. Metastasis is a complex multi-step process involving cancer cells, local vasculature, and the surrounding microenvironment at multiple sites. Venous invasion in pancreatic cancer, in which cancer cells gain often invade the portal vein, is an early step in this process and provides the cells a direct path to the liver, the most common site of pancreatic cancer metastasis. As in pancreatic cancer, invasion past normal breast tissue barriers is critically tied to breast cancer outcomes. Most breast tumors can be surgically removed, and so mortality is closely tied to the extent of distant metastasis through lymphovascular invasion. The detection of lymphovascular invasion in a breast tumor correlates with poor prognosis and is not captured in current molecular analyses. The spatial organization of cancer cells, and cellular and stromal components of the tumor microenvironment near and far away from blood vessels is intrinsically three-dimensional, non-symmetric, and highly heterogeneous. In the TECH units of the Johns Hopkins Center for 3D Multiscale Cancer Imaging, we will develop a versatile 3D multiscale imaging method, CODA, which will allow us to probe the phenotypic heterogeneity of tumors from the multi-cm to the micron scale via multiplexing serial imaging. CODA can readily incorporate other imaging modalities to extract high cellular/molecular content from 3D samples. These include immunocytochemistry (CODA+IHC), immunofluorescence (CODA+IF), imaging mass cytometry (CODA+IMC) and spatial transcriptomics/proteomics (CODA+DBiT-seq). These proposed expanded versions of CODA offer a unique opportunity to produce new 3D multi-omic maps of human PDAC and breast tumors near and far from blood vessels. CODA and its integrated versions CODA+X will be tested in the RTB units of the Center in both human/mouse tissue samples and organoids, in breast and pancreatic cancer. Results from these test beds will provide novel mechanistic insights into venous invasion in breast and pancreatic cancer. Exploiting our extensive experience in data dissemination, we will make the large datasets and software produced by our CODA+X platforms and software widely available to the larger cancer research community.

This presents a crucial barrier to the development of successful anti-cancer therapeutics. Transcriptional reprogramming and plasticity play a critical role in and out of the CSC state, which in turn are interdependent on the regulatory function of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of chromatin, epigenetic states, and other molecular events. Our understanding of fundamental CSC biology has been hampered by the need for cellular nanoscale imaging technologies that provide both highly detailed structural information regarding 3D chromatin organization and highly multiplexed molecular imaging of the many molecular regulators and events involved in CSC processes. We propose to establish the Northwestern University Center for Chromatin Nanoimaging in Cancer (NU-CCNIC) to address this fundamental technology gap in cellular nanoscale imaging and deploy the new technologies to address the fundamental knowledge gap in CSC biology. The Center converges experts in cellular nanoscale imaging, computational imaging, molecular modeling, computational genomics, CSC biology, and oncology. The Center will develop, test, validate, iterate, and deploy an integrated and co-registered Multi-scale Chromatin Nanoimaging Platform that will comprise three “nested-doll” imaging techniques: chromatin scanning transmission electron microscopy, optical spectroscopic super-resolution nanoscopy, and optical spectroscopic nanosensing. The Nanoimaging Platform will enable quantitative imaging of chromatin structure and highly multiplexed molecular and gene-specific localization, at the most fundamental length-scale approaching 1 nm resolution, including the imaging of statistically significant cell populations and live cells with high temporal resolution over prolonged temporal follow-up times. The Nanoimaging Platform will be bridged to computational genomics, epigenomics, genome mapping, and predictive transcriptional modeling datasets. These technologies will be deployed to answer several long-standing open questions in CSC biology. We will elucidate whether CSCs can originate from non-CSCs via transcriptional reprogramming, test the role of chromatin structure in fostering transcriptional plasticity in CSC processes, and explore the possibility of transcriptionally reprogramming CSCs to exit the stem-state as a new therapeutic strategy. All aspects of the technology development will be guided by the needs of the CSC biology testbed through a series of research feedback loops. In the long term, such single-cell nanoimaging technologies will help comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between structural, physico-chemical, and molecular genomic events.

Recent multi-region genomic analyses of one type of precancerous pancreatic lesion, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), suggest unique evolutionary and selective pressures in IPMNs compared to invasive cancers, underscoring the potential importance of selection in the progression of precancerous lesions. We propose to characterize the role of selective forces in IPMNs using comprehensive molecular analyses and computational data integration of both human IPMN tissue samples and organoid cultures. We will determine the molecular features of progressed subclones in human IPMN samples using multi-region whole genome sequencing and RNA-sequencing. In addition, we will develop and apply novel multi-omics computational methods to integrate DNA and RNA-sequencing data to delineate selective forces in human IPMNs. We will determine the function of progressed clones identified by whole genome DNA sequencing with gene signatures inferred from bulk transcriptional data in a new semi-supervised framework. We will then employ a three-dimensional in vitro organoid culture model of human IPMN cells to characterize the relative contributions of selective pressures over time. We will use combined DNA sequencing and single-cell RNA- sequencing to identify gene expression signatures of progressed subclones in our organoid model, further adapting our computational framework to single cell RNA-sequencing data.

Despite these breakthroughs, the efficacy of ICB-based immunotherapy is limited to a subset of cancers, and even in tumors where ICB is now the standard of care, only a fraction of patients achieve durable complete responses. Addressing these limitations requires (1) improving our fundamental understanding of tumor-immune interactions in immunological contexts where current immunotherapies fail and (2) developing novel strategies for enhancing responses in contexts where they have only partial success. The Center for Tumor-Immune Systems Biology at MSKCC has assembled a multi-disciplinary team of leading investigators in computational biology, immunology, and cancer biology to tackle these challenges. The Center is organized around three Research Projects that integrate computational and experimental studies in mouse models and molecular analyses in patient tumors in both immunotherapy-resistant and -responsive contexts, exploiting novel machine learning modeling of single-cell multiome, highly multiplexed optical imaging using confocal immunofluorescence, and spatial transcriptomic data sets. We will investigate distinct immune microenvironments where cancers are refractory to ICB: metastatic colonization of the brain, an immune- privileged organ where the interplay of cancer cells, astrocytes, and different states of disease-associated microglia dictate modes of invasion (Project I); and mismatch-repair proficient primary colon cancer, where tumors reside in a tolerizing microenvironment and interact with complex cellular circuits of regulatory and conventional T cells, together with metastases to the lymph node and liver (Project II). We will also carry out a systems biology interrogation of cancer cell death mechanisms in models of ICB-responsive melanoma and renal cell carcinoma, based on findings that engineering mitochondrial damage-dependent but caspase- independent cell death elicits anti-cancer immunity and protection against tumor rechallenge (Project III). A Shared Resource Core will interact with all three Research Projects to develop computational methods and establish technologies for spatial analyses of the tumor-immune microenvironment. These studies will advance our fundamental understanding of tumor-immune ecosystems in ICB-refractory microenvironments and of immune responses to therapeutically induced immunogenic cancer cell death in ICB-responsive settings, ultimately leading to novel immunotherapeutic targets and combination strategies.

These organelles must adapt to oncogenic stress in order for tumors to initiate and progress, but there is little to no systems-level understanding of how such adaptations occur and what vulnerabilities might be created. The Systems Analysis of Stress-adapted Cancer Organelles (SASCO) Center at the University of Virginia will address this challenge by mechanistic modeling of organellar processes that iterates with quantitative experiments in disease-relevant cell cultures and primary tumors. The working SASCO Center hypothesis is that organelle-specific adaptation to oncogenic stress occurs through a few critical bottlenecks, which become identifiable once the relevant signaling, metabolic, and transport pathways have been properly integrated. The Center brings together 14 investigators with primary and collaborative track records in cancer biology, systems biology, genetically engineered mouse models of cancer, and clinical practice. Three Research Projects and one Shared Research Core will pursue a common research strategy, which leverages mechanistic models to test competing alternative hypotheses about how organelles adapt to stresses from proximal oncogenes that drive specific types of cancer. The Projects are organized hierarchically as organelle stresses downstream of proliferation-inducing oncogenes. Project 1 will examine the chromosome passenger complex and its regulated phase separation during metaphase as an organelle that senses and repairs spindle defects to suppress breast cancer aneuploidy driven by mitotic transcription factors. Project 2 will evaluate the metabolic consequences of chronic mitochondrial fragmentation caused by mutant KRAS in primary colorectal cancers and secondary liver metastases.

These data have made it clear that every cancer is a distinct genetic disease, with tumors that look physiologically similar often driven by patterns of gene mutations that are strikingly different. Due to this molecular heterogeneity, it is typically unclear what are the key driver mutations or dependencies in a given cancer and how these influence pathogenesis and response to therapy. One key observation for interpreting tumor genomes is that the many rare tumor mutations can be shown to converge on common molecular networks. Based on this premise we created the Cancer Cell Map Initiative (CCMI), whose mission is to create comprehensive maps of cancer molecular networks and to use these maps in intelligent systems for personalized therapy. In 2017, the CCMI was funded as an NCI U54 Research Center for Cancer Systems Biology, integrating expertise in network mapping, bioinformatic analysis and cancer research from leading academic laboratories at two University of California campuses (UCSF and UCSD). We have since generated comprehensive networks of protein interactions in breast and head-and-neck tumor cells and, from these data, identified several hundred protein complexes under selective mutational pressure in cancer (NeST v1.0). We have piloted deep learning systems (DCell, DrugCell and TCRP) that can use this protein network information to translate a patient‚Äôs tumor mutation profile to a predicted drug response, including FDA-approved and exploratory agents. We have implemented a rich portfolio of training opportunities and, leveraging UC institutional support, expanded the CCMI consortium to include more than a dozen faculty at UC and, most recently, Stanford. In the next five years, the CCMI will seek to: (1) Generate comprehensive protein interaction networks centered on key cancer driver genes in lung squamous cells (in healthy and diseased states) as well as the PIK3CA and TP53 pathways, which are central to many tumor types; (2) Systematically extend the CCMI collection of cancer protein interaction data with protein immunofluorescent imaging and cryo-electron microscopy to formulate multi-scale cancer cell maps; (3) Dissect the functional logic of these networks and maps by systematic genetic screening experiments in the same tumor types and pathways, using a panel of scalable cell proliferation, phenotype and pathway readouts; (4) Significantly advance and harden our DrugCell interpretable deep learning system for cancer precision medicine; (5) Train the current and next generation of scientists in network biology and its applications to cancer research; and (6) Continue to build a cadre of leading investigators to expand CCMI into a global coordinated partnership",U54,"Heterogeneity, Computational Resource",University of California; San Francisco,UCSF,"Nevan J.

GrantView,CA274504,Mathematical Oncology Systems Analysis Imaging Center (MOSAIC),CA274504,"Glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive primary brain cancer, is amongst the most heterogeneous of cancers, both intra- and inter-tumorally. GBMs are an admixture of neoplastic glioma cells and non-neoplastic / reactive brain parenchyma that contribute to the overall imageable tumor mass. As such, cellular content, including both cellular density and cellular composition, is critically important for understanding the status and evolution of a given tumor. Although MRI provides excellent soft tissue contrast and can noninvasively characterize anatomy, no methods exist to integrate a spatial and temporal understanding of the cellular components of the tumor inferred from imaging in vivo. It has become increasingly clear that precision oncology strategies rely on a quantitative and predictive understanding of the state of the cancer complex system evolving within each patient. Recent findings from our group have revealed two key opportunities we seek to leverage in our proposed Mathematical Oncology Systems Analysis Imaging Center (MOSAIC). First, molecular analysis of a cohort of our image-localized biopsies of GBM have inspired the concept of Glioma Tissue States as a composite classification of tissue samples. Our findings from single nucleus RNAseq reveal that specific subpopulations and cellular phenotypes of neoplastic and non- neoplastic cells show distinct patterns of co-habitation constraining potential cross-talk signaling. Second, we have found mathematical modeling and machine learning analyses of clinical MRI features of GBM biopsies are able to predict loco-regional features of GBM biology in vivo. These image-based models provide the promise to track aspects of intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity previously unattainable during patient care. Our overall center vision is to build a conceptual framework to understand tissue state-associated cellular composition transitions that happen in glioma and the ways to interpret MRI relative to those changes for these key cellular phenotypes. Specifically, in Project 1 we will explore strategies to target unfavorable (unresponsive) tissue states to navigate transitions of the cancer complex system towards more favorable (responsive) tissue states. In Project 2 we will leverage mathematical modeling and machine learning approaches to fuse MRI and image-localized biopsy quantified tissue states to enable tracking tissue state changes in patient receiving standard of care and immunotherapy strategies.

Tumor heterogeneity adds further complexity by fostering reprogramming, adaptation, selection, and ultimately expansion of drug-resistant cells, as well as emergence of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), both of which are ultimately responsible for patient relapse and poor outcome. Addressing these challenges—i.e., identifying more universal, mechanism-based targets for pharmacological intervention and assessing their potential value in highly heterogeneous tumors—is critically dependent on the availability of accurate, comprehensive, and cell type-specific molecular interaction networks (cellular networks, hereafter), which underlie both the cell-autonomous behavior of cancer cells and their interaction with other TME subpopulations.

Tumors are not simply collections of mutated cells that grow in isolation. Rather, they respond to and modify both the physical microenvironment and a variety of host cells, and these changes in ecology (“∆-Ecology”) are key to understanding tumor progression and the response to therapy – particularly the development of resistance. Central to this proposal is quantifying, understanding, and actioning the change that occurs during treatment to both the tumor and non-tumor ecology in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is the most common and among the most lethal of human cancers. We will define the ecological and evolutionary dynamics that govern NSCLC progression and treatment success or failure through 2 projects and 2 shared resource cores. Each project will focus on different D-Ecology dynamics in the presence of different driver mutations (RAS, EGFR, ALK) for which targeted therapy is available. Each project demonstrates our unifying theme of tight empirical/mathematical integration through the sequence of develop, predict, calibrate, test, optimize, and validate. Thus, each project begins with available clinical data followed by in silico (predict and optimize), in vitro (calibrate and test) and in vivo (validate) model systems leading to readily translatable treatment options. The mathematical and ecological Cores incorporate the mathematical and computational methods needed for bridging the projects.

Analysis of retrospective clinical data coupled with in vivo therapeutic modeling using syngeneic models of murine melanoma strongly support this concept. In fact, the picture that has emerged in melanoma is that immune factors can play a strong role in driving resistance to MAPK inhibitor (MAPKi) therapy, and that lead-in immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) can ‘prime’ both the primary tumor and distal metastases (including brain metastases) for eradication when the IT is subsequently combined with MAPKi. This observation opens the doors for immune based strategies, such as ICB or adoptive cell therapy (ACT), as sequential combinatorial agents to prevent MAPKi resistance. However, this concept introduces a number of new variables, including dosing, sequence, and timing. This can make the design and execution of clinical trials that can yield statistically significant outcomes impractical. This is the scientific and translational problem we address in the proposed ST-Analytics U54. The ST-Analytics U54 center is populated by leading scientists at the ISB, the UCLA Geffen School of Medicine, and Yale, and is comprised of two research projects and two research cores, with each project integrating both state-of-the-art experimentation and computational work.

GrantView,CA274511,Systems Biology of Tumor-Immune-Stromal Interactions in Metastatic Progression,CA274511,"Overall Distant metastasis is the primary cause of cancer-related death. To colonize distant tissues, cancer cells must migrate while evading elimination by the immune system. Evidence suggests that key steps in the induction process of immune tolerance occur early in the metastatic cascade, located at the regional lymph nodes proximal to the primary tumor site. However, the nature of the interactions between malignant, immune and stromal cells remains poorly understood, including those that involve metastatic cells within the lymph nodes. Even though lymph nodes are in fact commonly assessed in cancer patients to determine disease stage and treatment plan, they are understudied in the context of metastatic progression. To fill this scientific knowledge gap, we propose a Research Center to unravel the role of lymph nodes in metastatic progression. We have established that lymph node metastasis constitutes an essential, first step in the metastatic cascade of cancer progression. We have found that such metastases act locally upon the adaptive immune system within the lymph nodes to begin to induce systemic tolerance of the tumor. We will further explore this new paradigm of metastases in two malignancies, head and neck cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, by focusing on the kinetics and spatiotemporal changes at the primary tumor, lymph node and distant sites, associated with the onset and progression of metastasis. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team whose coordinated efforts will involve the application of genomic and single-cell in-situ imaging technologies on preclinical and human samples to explore the evidence and mechanisms of the induction of immunosuppression in the lymph nodes. We propose two Research Projects that focus our scientific theme on lymph node metastasis by analyzing kinetics in a mouse model (Project 1) and spatial temporal changes in samples of lymph nodes and their concurrent primary tumor (Project 2), inter-connected through integrative computational analyses. Both projects will utilize a shared resource core dedicated to the acquisition of patient samples and associated clinical annotation and data management (Biospecimen Core and Data Core). These efforts will yield highly multiplexed, multi-scale datasets which will be analyzed by novel bio-computational methods to reconstruct intracellular and intercellular molecular interaction networks in order to identify, then functionally validate, critical mediators of metastasis. Our ultimate objective is to advance our understanding of the systemic consequences of lymph node metastases and identify new biomarkers and therapeutic approaches. Our Research Center is also dedicated to promoting our early investigators as the next generation thought leaders applying principles of systems biology to the study of metastasis. Our Outreach Core activity will ensure that our Research Center’s scientific and methodological advances in applying the principles of cancer systems biology toward the study of tumor-immune-stromal interactions are fully disseminated in the cancer research and broader communities.",U54,Metastasis,Stanford University,Stanford,"Sylvia Katina Plevritis, Edgar G.

GrantView,CA275808,Modeling based design of chimeric antigen receptors for Natural Killer cell-based immunotherapy,CA275808,"Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune effector cells that play an immediate role in host defense. The activation of NK cells is mediated by receptor-ligand interactions and downstream intracellular signaling path- ways. One type of immunotherapy that has achieved great success in recent years is based on chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). These are engineered receptors composed of both target recognition and cell activation func- tions that can direct immune cells to mediate killing of cancer cells. Although T cells are the predominant immune cell type used for CAR-based immunotherapy, NK cells provide significant advantages over CAR-engineered T cells because they can be derived from non-autologous sources. However, most studies testing CAR-NK cells have used CAR constructs based on T cell signaling pathways that are not optimized for NK cell signaling. In addition, the development of CAR constructs is largely achieved using a trial-and-error experimental approach, and there is no systematic understanding of how altering the CAR signaling domains influences cell activation. The main objective of this proposal is to identify effective NK based-CAR designs using systems biology tools. Our approach combines computational modeling and quantitative phospho-proteomics to generate a de- tailed understanding of CAR-mediated NK cell signaling and cytotoxicity. The outcome of our work will be a set of validated NK CARs that target and kill BCMA-positive multiple myeloma (MM) cancer cells. We will also test the optimized CARs against CS1-expressing MM cells. The approach builds on our team‚Äôs extensive experience in modeling and characterizing cell signaling and studying NK cell biology. Guided by strong preliminary data, we propose to pursue three Specific Aims: (1) Characterize intracellular and cellular-level responses of CAR- expressing NK cells; (2) Develop computational models to predict the dynamic responses of CAR-expressing NK cells; (3) Identify novel CAR constructs that effectively activate NK cells. Collectively, our proposed research will generate a quantitative understanding of how CAR signaling encodes NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and how NK-CAR constructs can be optimized for cancer immunotherapy. Our research will broadly impact the field of cancer immunotherapy by providing insight into how intracellular NK cell signaling and CAR structure influence NK cell activation. Ultimately, this research will expand our knowledge of NK cell signaling and the design criteria for NK-CAR-based immunotherapy for other tumor types and cancer antigens.

GrantView,CA279408,A novel breast cancer therapy based on secreted protein ligands from CD36+ fibroblasts,CA279408,"A novel breast cancer therapy based on secreted protein ligands from CD36+ fibroblasts Cancer cells recruit and alter fibroblasts' biochemical and physical properties (FBs) to benefit their growth. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have emerged as potential targets for reprogramming the tumor microenvironment and for optimizing therapeutic strategies. However, there is a critical gap in research targeting tumors and CAFs simultaneously. Breast cancer tumors have distinct subtypes. And there is a lack of a biochemical marker exclusive to CAFs because of their heterogeneity. In fact, the currently available CAF- targeted therapies succumb to off-target effects, so their applications are limited. We aim to address this conundrum by testing our central hypothesis that factors secreted from non-cancer-associated FBs that express CD36—a cell surface receptor downregulated in CAFs—could be utilized as an alternative strategy to induce growth suppression in subtypes of breast cancer while upregulating CD36 in CAFs. This hypothesis is based on our pilot study showing that co-transplantation of breast cancer cells with CD36+ FBs dramatically suppressed tumor growth in animals. Furthermore, for the first time, we identified three active protein ligands in the secretome of CD36+ FBs and determined the effective concentration of their corresponding recombinant proteins that induce growth suppression in breast cancer cell lines while overexpressing CD36 in at least one CAF model. This study is significant because it will have a positive translational impact on breast cancer therapy with reduced toxicity. We will continue to test our hypothesis through two specific aims and the integration of a novel technological platform: Aim 1a will identify breast cancer subtypes that are sensitive to the three recombinant proteins (RPs). To this end, we will employ 3D cultures of the established cell lines and patient-derived organoids. We will also investigate the overexpression of CD36, by the active ligands, on a panel of CAFs. To facilitate a large number of experimental variables and intrinsic heterogeneity of organoids, we will develop a novel high-throughput imaging and high-content screening by coupling printed 3D cultures or organoids with 3D microscopy and deep learning methods for quantitative profiling of 3D organization and molecular features. Aim 1b will determine the mechanisms by which the three recombinant proteins induce (a) growth suppression in sensitive breast cancer subtypes or (b) upregulate CD36 in CAFs. Mechanistic studies will be anchored by apoptotic pathways, the cis- regulatory networks' prediction, and the application of bioinformatics techniques. It will also include the mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction induced by RPs. Aim 2 will use mouse models to investigate tumor suppression in sensitive cell lines, mouse tumors, and PDX models. Resected tumors will also be profiled for tumor morphology and molecular endpoints using advanced computational methods. In addition, in select cases, tumor sections will be complemented with spatial proteomics/transcriptomic for additional mechanistic studies.

GrantView,CA279560,Tissue-Engineered Models of Lymphatic Drainage in Breast Cancer,CA279560,"Breast cancer is a second leading cause of cancer death in women, exceeded only by lung cancer. Among the different subtypes, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) that does not express the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, is characterized by poor prognostic outcomes. TNBC forms solid tumors with high interstitial fluid pressure (IFP). High IFP promotes tumor progression several ways and cancer immunotherapies are also compromised in TNBC tumors with high IFP since the interstitial pressure keeps immune cells from infiltrating into tumors. While solid stress formed by fibrotic tumor extracellular matrix contributes to tumor IFP formation, hyperpermeable blood vessels, combined with compromised lymphatic drainage, lead to high IFP. To decrease tumor IFP, researchers have tried to reduce solid stress and normalize leaky blood vessels in tumors. However, how lymphatic drainage is impaired in tumor microenvironment and how the impaired lymphatic function affects tumor IFP, immune cell interactions, and anti- tumor immunity are still ambiguous. Several studies have reported that lymphatic vessels (LVs) are structurally and functionally impaired in tumors, and lymphangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC) treatment inhibited tumor growth by promoting lymphangiogenesis and boosting T cell recruitment to the tumors. However, VEGFC has also been recognized to promote lymph node metastasis. Given the conflicting effects of VEGFC, the main goals of this project are to normalize lymphatic drainage in TNBC without using VEGFC or without promoting lymphangiogensis, by deciphering the mechanisms of lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) junction remodeling in TNBC. In this proposal, we will use physiologically responsive in vitro 3D systems of lymphatic vessels co-cultured with breast cancer cells, which can recapitulate lymphatic structure, lymphatic drainage, and immune cell interactions in breast cancer. With these organotypic 3D model systems, we will examine lymphatic junction morphogenesis and drainage in TNBC in the context of a tissue-like and in vivo environment, examine LEC junction zippering in TNBC-associated LECs, evaluate the roles of lymphatic function in dendritic cell trafficking to lymphatics, T cell activation, and T cell infiltration in tumors; and assess the roles of LEC junction zippering for anti-tumor immunity. If successful, our studies will not only identify new targets to treat breast cancer, but also provide a new tool for mechanism studies and fast screening of potential drug candidates to treat cancer and lymphatic disease.",R01,"Tumor-Immune, Tumor Progression",Cornell University,Cornell,Esak Lee,TEC,6/23/23,5/31/28,https://reporter.nih.gov/search/530k0RP8tUaYolclDKA8mw/projects,4,,https://www.synapse.org/#!Team:3490495,https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn53212950/wiki/625631,409956b0-89d6-4252-b505-506925cb9f57,syn53259587
GrantView,CA280829,Extending experimental evolutionary game theory in cancer in vivo to enable clinical translation: integrating spatio-temporal dynamics using mathematical modeling,CA280829,"Targeted cancer therapy, in the form of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, has been a game changer for patients with cancers driven by activating mutations in genes encoding these proteins. Yet, while we are seeing overall survival beneﬁts unlike with any new agents in over a decade, cures remain elusive, or non-existent, as resistance to these agents reliably emerges. The process driving this resistance is the same process that drives invasive pests' resistance to pesticides, pathogens' resistance to antibiotics and many other phenomena in life: Darwinian evolution. While this is being increasingly recognized, it has yet to change the paradigm in cancer research where most projects are centered on a hunt for actionable mutations conferring resistance. While these secondary mutations are often druggable themselves, we submit that this is a never-ending race that evolution will always win. We hypothesize that an approach centered instead on studying the evolutionary process itself can help break this cycle. While there is a robust theoretical literature modeling cancer evolution with mathematics, there is a relative paucity of research connecting this theory to empirical biology or clinical medicine. To address this shortcoming, we have worked for the past three years to develop a ﬁrst-in-class evolutionary game assay to directly measure the eco-evolutionary interactions driving the emergence of resistance in vitro. This assay allows us to directly parameterize an evolutionary game theoretic model with empiric studies in any system. Here, we propose to extend our initial observations revealing a vast heterogeneity in evolutionary dynamics under different agents in vitro to allow for clinical translation by extend ouring assay to an in vivo system.

GrantView,CA280849,Fractionated photoimmunotherapy to harness low-dose immunostimulation in ovarian cancer,CA280849,"The survival of advanced or recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remains dismal due in part to the complex tumor–immune microenvironment (TIME). The presence of tumor-infiltrating T cells correlates with improved patient outcome in advanced EOC, yet checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy has generally shown poor efficacy against EOC in clinical trials. A major challenge is the low number of T cells compared to EOC cells in the tumor that establish an immune-suppressive TIME. Tumor-targeted, cell-activatable photoimmunotherapy (taPIT, a near infrared phototherapy) may provide an alternative treatment approach that selectively destroys EOC cells expressing cell-surface epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) while enhancing the preservation of tumor infiltrating immune cells salient to an adaptive immune response (e.g., local cytotoxic T cells and dendritic cells). While photoimmunotherapy is not new, this is the first exploration of taPIT dose fractionation to selective eradicate EOC while stimulating immune cells at lower doses and preferentially sparing immune cells at higher doses. Based on our rich preliminary data, we propose that mathematical modeling-informed taPIT serves as a new paradigm for combined cytotoxic therapy and immunotherapy in metastatic EOC. Our overall goal is a novel experimental, simulation- and image-guided approach for utilizing the local selectivity of taPIT to prime “cold” TIME’s for immune checkpoint inhibition. This proposal contributes an innovative physical sciences approach to cancer therapy integrating mathematical modeling with a 3D culture model of the TIME and in vivo imaging experiments in immunocompetent mouse models of EOC, including in silico immuno-oncology modeling to optimize TIME composition-specific therapy; fractionated taPIT dosimetry to reduce the EOC cell burden relative to effector T cells and dendritic cells within the TIME; and, in vivo multiplexed fluorescence microendoscopy to interrogate the TIME of metastatic EOC within the peritoneal cavity. The unique ability to image micronodular disease will enable parameterizing a mathematical model with pre-treatment conditions and dynamic in vivo responses to therapy as a basis for the quantitative design of custom-tailored therapies. Our aims are (1) to train an in silico model by correlating clinical pre-treatment EOC TIME compositions with pathological anti-PD1 response; (2) to derive optimal fractionated taPIT protocols that shift “cold” to anti-PD1-sensitive “hot” TIME in vitro, and (3) to prime the TIME for anti-PD1 therapy in vivo. The concepts introduced here will ultimately enable taPIT–anti-PD1 therapy dosimetry that synergistically stimulates both local and distal immune-enhancing effects to impact disease sites missed by near infrared light, in combination with frontline surgical tumor debulking and systemic chemotherapy.

GrantView,CA280984,Dysregulated mechanoimmunology of epigenetics-driven lymphomas,CA280984,"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL) arise from germinal center (GC) B cells; a stage at which precursor B cells undergo rounds of proliferation, edit their immunoglobulins by somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination, followed by affinity selection via interactions with T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). The entry to, and exit from, the GC reaction requires extensive changes in gene expression that are controlled by transcription factors that recruit co-activators or co- repressors that drive epigenetic and transcriptional changes. The dysregulation of these molecular programs perturbs the normal B cell differentiation and contributes to FL/DLBCLs. Prior studies indicate that (a) EZH2 regulates the hyperproliferative nature of GC B cells and (b) gain-of-function mutations of the EZH2 Y641 residue “initiate” lymphomagenesis by attenuating GC B cell requirement for Tfh cell help and shifting the dependency to FDCs through increased expression of receptors through which B-cells interface with these stromal cells. Ezh2Y641F GC B cells evade Tfh-directed clonal selection and affinity maturation to escape Tfh-mediated elimination, leading to lymphomagenesis. Notably, compared to EZH2WT, GC B cells carrying Ezh2Y641F show increased and decreased BAFFR and CD40 expressions, respectively, and escape CD40L blockade-mediated impairment of GC reaction. It is unclear whether the impairment of Tfh help manifests as dysregulation of the mechanical control of Tfh–B immunological synapse (IS) and alteration of their intercellular receptor-ligand interactions and signaling in FL/DLBCLs. The overarching hypothesis is that in contrast to GC B cells with EZH2WT, the EZH2Y641 mutation in GCB DLBCL/FL results in dysregulation of key immunoreceptors mediating the interactions of GC B cells with Tfh cells and FDCs manifesting as altered receptor forces, ligand binding, and mechanotransduction. The dysregulated receptor mechanobiology impacts downstream B cell signaling, epigenetics, and sensing of lymphoid microenvironmental cues responsible for extinguishing the “pseudo- malignant” phenotype of GC B cells, thereby driving the cancerous transformation of B cells. Our transcriptomic analysis suggests changes in the levels of proteins involved in B–FDC and B–Tfh interactions, which should affect cellular function.

The lack of response to immunotherapy strategies despite prominent infiltrates of immune cells in many GBM highlights the immuno- suppressive nature of the GBM microenvironment and the importance of more clearly understanding the dynamic interactions at the tumor/immune interface. Similarly, interactions between tumor cells and neural cells in the tumor microenvironment have emerged as driving forces in tumor progression and invasion, with electrical signals from neurons providing growth and migration stimuli to tumor cells, while tumor cells lead to aberrant electrical signaling in local neurons. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that developing a systems-level understanding of the dynamic interactions between tumor cells, neurons and immune cells will provide unprecedented insights into glioma tumor biology and foster development of novel therapeutic strategies to abrogate tumor invasion, enhance the efficacy of cytotoxic therapies, and increase clearance of tumor burden by the innate and adaptive immune system.

GrantView,CA284086,The Impact of Metastatic Site On Dendritic Cell-Driven Tumor Immunity,CA284086,"The prognosis for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) patients is dismal. Unfortunately, attempts at immunotherapy for PDAC to date using single agents have not achieved significant clinical benefits. This is likely due to the presence of a uniquely suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Our recent data suggest that immune priming by dendritic cells (cDCs) may ultimately a rate-liming barrier to productive anti-tumor immunity. While the focus of research in pancreatic cancer has been on the TME during primary disease, we are only now realizing how significant the differences in the TME are between primary and metastatic disease and/or metastatic lesions in different organs. These differences are critical, as the majority of immunotherapeutic approaches are being tested in refractory metastatic PDAC patients. We will address this shortcoming in understanding metastatic PDAC biology by determining the differential impact of metastatic disease site(s) on immune priming by cDCs. cDCs are central for generating tumor antigen-specific T-cell responses. In animal models and human correlative studies, cDCs are crucial for responsiveness to both cytotoxic and checkpoint immunotherapies. Our published data show that cDCs were severely dysfunctional in PDAC patients and that this dysfunction was driven by two distinct mechanisms. First, we reported that PDAC patients had impaired cDC development in their bone marrow, which led to a functional depletion of circulating pre-DCs, impaired cross-presentation of tumor antigens, and poor responses to checkpoint inhibitors. Even when DC development is not fully impaired, we've shown cDCs are dysfunctional and excluded from the PDAC TME. Overall, these mechanisms impair the ability of conventional therapies to prime tumor antigen-specific T-cell responses and checkpoint immunotherapy to drive efficacy. Together these data support our hypothesis that metastatic organ site-specific drivers lead to divergent effects on local and systemic tumor immunities. We will directly address this hypothesis with the following aims: Aim 1. Determine the impacts of the site of metastatic disease on immune priming by cDCs. Aim 2. Determine the impacts of the site of metastatic disease on systemic immunity and cDC development. Aim 3. Determine how therapy differentially shapes the TME at different metastatic sites to impact immune priming.

We hypothesize that the interaction between a cancer cell's intrinsic reactivation of developmental programs with its spatiotemporal context determines its metastatic potential. We will exploit developmental changes in the mammary epithelium to define their cell state basis and map the aberrant reuse of these transcriptional programs in metastatic disease. Both normal mammary epithelium and breast tumors undergo dramatic changes in differentiation and tissue architecture, and loss of differentiation correlates with poor patient outcomes. We developed 3D culture assays that recapitulate epithelial morphogenesis and cancer growth, invasion, and metastatic colony formation. The key concepts arising are that: (1) a conserved process of dedifferentiation and loss of polarity accompanies both normal and neoplastic morphogenesis and (2) the cancer cells in luminal and basal breast cancer recapitulate basal epithelial and hybrid EMT programs. Recent advances in single cell sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and machine learning enable transcriptome-wide resolution of these states in tissue, quantitative comparison of normal and cancerous cell states, and the identification of targetable cell state regulators. Aim 1: Map cell states in space and time during development, tumor formation, and metastasis. We will generate scRNA-seq data from normal glands, ductal carcinoma in situ, and invasive tumors collected at different ages and also longitudinally in 3D culture. We will use our CoGAPS algorithm to infer cell states and their temporal progression. We will then use our patternMarker2 statistic to identify cell state makers for MERSCOPE analysis in tissue. We will map these states in normal glands, primary tumors, and metastases isolated from genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) and patient derived xenografts (PDX). Aim 2: Model the dynamics of differentiation state during development and cancer progression. To define the effect of cell state on metastatic progression, we will construct an ecosystem-style multinomial diversity model. We will initialize the model with literature-based parameter values to predict the interactions between cell type and cell state. We will then extend the model to use the weights assigned by CoGAPS to each cell, thereby linking gene regulatory programs to the cell state changes driving metastasis. Aim 3: Validate candidate regulators of metastatic cell state transitions in 3D culture and in vivo. To isolate the genes regulating metastasis, we will use our transfer learning algorithm, projectR, to score each cancer cell for its relative utilization of scRNA-seq-defined molecular programs.
