The heterogeneous, context-dependent nature of cancer cell metabolism, however, poses challenges to identifying effective therapeutic interventions. Here, we utilize various unsupervised and supervised multivariate modeling approaches to systematically pinpoint recurrent metabolic states within hundreds of cancer cell lines, elucidate their association with tumor lineage and growth environments, and uncover vulnerabilities linked to their metabolic states across diverse genetic and tissue contexts. We validate key findings via analysis of data from patient-derived tumors and pharmacological screens and by performing genetic and pharmacological experiments. Our analysis uncovers synthetically lethal associations between the tumor metabolic state (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation), driver mutations (e.g., loss of tumor suppressor PTEN), and actionable biological targets (e.g., mitochondrial electron transport chain). Investigating the mechanisms underlying these relationships can inform the development of more precise and context-specific, metabolism-targeted cancer therapies.","Western Blotting, RNA Sequencing, Cell Culture",Pan-Cancer,Not Applicable,,Open Access

These data have been essential in developing molecular models of how tumors develop, evolve, and respond to environmental changes, such as therapeutic intervention. A deeper understanding of tumor evolution has subsequently opened up new research efforts to develop mathematical models that account for evolutionary dynamics with the goal of predicting drug response and resistance in cancer.

HGSOC spreads when single cells and spheroids detach, float through the peritoneal fluid and take over new sites, with spheroids thought to be more aggressive than single cells. Using our in vitro model of spheroid collective detachment, we determine that increased substrate stiffness led to the detachment of more spheroids. We identified a mechanism where Piezo1 activity increased MMP-1/MMP-10, decreased collagen I and fibronectin, and increased spheroid detachment. Piezo1 expression was confirmed in omental masses from patients with stage III/IV HGSOC. Using OV90 and CRISPR-modified <i>PIEZO1</i><sup>-/-</sup> OV90 in a mouse xenograft model, we determined that while both genotypes efficiently took over the omentum, loss of Piezo1 significantly decreased ascitic volume, tumor spheroids in the ascites, and the number of macroscopic tumors in the mesentery. These results support that slowing collective detachment may benefit patients and identify Piezo1 as a potential therapeutic target.",,,,,Open Access

Histological and genetic analysis have confirmed the secretory epithelial of the fallopian tube (FT) as a major site of origin of HGSOC. Although there have been significant strides in our understanding of this disease, early stage detection and diagnosis are still rare. Current clinical imaging modalities lack the ability to detect early stage pathogenesis in the fallopian tubes and the ovaries. However, there are several microscopic imaging techniques used to analyze the structural modifications in the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein collagen in ex vivo FT and ovarian tissues that potentially can be modified to fit the clinical setting.

Herein, we show that radiation combined with adjuvant NSAID (indomethacin) treatment provides a powerful combination to reduce both primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in aggressive 4T1 TNBC tumors, which occurs in part through increased antitumor immune response. Spatial immunological changes including augmented lymphoid infiltration into the tumor epithelium and locally increased cGAS/STING1 and type I IFN gene expression were observed in radiation-indomethacin-treated 4T1 tumors.

It is unclear how intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) contributes to metastasis and how metastatic cells adapt to distant tissue environments. The study of these adaptations is challenged by the limited access to patient material and a lack of experimental models that appropriately recapitulate ITH. To investigate metastatic cell adaptations and the contribution of ITH to metastasis, we analyzed single-cell transcriptomes of matched primary tumors and metastases from patient-derived xenograft models of breast cancer. We found profound transcriptional differences between the primary tumor and metastatic cells. Primary tumors upregulated several metabolic genes, whereas motility pathway genes were upregulated in micrometastases, and stress response signaling was upregulated during progression. Additionally, we identified primary tumor gene signatures that were associated with increased metastatic potential and correlated with patient outcomes. Immune-regulatory control pathways were enriched in poorly metastatic primary tumors, whereas genes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition were upregulated in highly metastatic tumors. We found that ITH was dominated by epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP), which presented as a dynamic continuum with intermediate EMP cell states characterized by specific genes such as CRYAB and S100A2. Elevated expression of an intermediate EMP signature correlated with worse patient outcomes. Our findings identified inhibition of the intermediate EMP cell state as a potential therapeutic target to block metastasis.",,,,,Open Access

Fibroblasts invaded as individual cells and established a multicellular network, which transited to a two-compartment fibrotic response displaying an αSMA cold external capsule and a long-lasting, inner αSMA hot environment. The recruitment of fibroblasts and extent of fibrosis were only incompletely inhibited after depletion of macrophages, implicating coexistence of macrophage-dependent and macrophage-independent mediators. Furthermore, neither altering material type or porosity modulated αSMA<sup>+</sup> cell recruitment and distribution. This identifies fibroblast activation and network formation toward a two-compartment FBR as a conserved, self-organizing process partially independent of macrophages.",,,,,Open Access

Medicine studies pathological variation among humans (and domestic animals in veterinary medicine) and evolutionary biology studies variation within and among species in general. A key principle of evolutionary biology is that genetic differences among species have arisen first from mutations originating within populations. This implies a mechanistic continuity between variation among individuals within a species and variation between species. This fact motivates research that seeks to leverage comparisons among species to unravel the genetic basis of human disease vulnerabilities. This view also implies that genetically caused diseases can be understood as extreme states of an underlying trait, that is, an axis of variation, rather than distinct traits, as often assumed in GWAS studies. We illustrate these points with a number of examples as diverse as anatomical birth defects, cranio-facial variation, preeclampsia and vulnerability to metastatic cancer.",,,,,Open Access

Identification and mapping of the mechanical cues conducive to cytoskeletal remodelling and cell adaptation may help to establish environmental contexts that can be used prospectively as translational design specifications to target tissue neogenesis for regenerative medicine. In this review, we summarize findings on cytoskeletal remodelling in the context of tissue neogenesis during early development and postnatal healing, and its relevance in guiding lineage commitment for targeted tissue regeneration. We highlight how cytoskeleton-targeting chemical agents modulate stem cell differentiation and govern responses to mechanical cues in stem cells' emerging form and function. We further review methods for spatiotemporal visualization and measurement of cytoskeletal remodelling, as well as its effects on the mechanical properties of cells, as a function of adaptation.

However, pancreatic cancers are often poorly vascularized and limited in glutamine supply, in alignment with recent concerns on the significance of glutaminolysis in pancreatic cancer.

Recent studies have established the capacity of the invading tumor spheroids to evolve into coexistent solid-like, fluid-like, and gas-like phases. Using breast cancer cell lines invading into engineered ECM, here we show that the spheroid interior develops spatial and temporal heterogeneities in material phase which, depending upon cell type and matrix density, ultimately result in a variety of phase separation patterns at the invasive front. Using a computational approach, we further show that these patterns are captured by a novel jamming phase diagram.

Identifying effective therapies for drug resistant tumors is integral for improving patient outcomes. Methods: In this study, we applied a computational drug repositioning approach to identify potential agents to sensitize primary drug resistant breast cancers. We extracted drug resistance profiles from the I-SPY 2 TRIAL, a neoadjuvant trial for early stage breast cancer, by comparing gene expression profiles of responder and non-responder patients stratified into treatments within HR/HER2 receptor subtypes, yielding 17 treatment-subtype pairs. We then used a rank-based pattern-matching strategy to identify compounds in the Connectivity Map, a database of cell line derived drug perturbation profiles, that can reverse these signatures in a breast cancer cell line. We hypothesize that reversing these drug resistance signatures will sensitize tumors to treatment and prolong survival. Results: We found that few individual genes are shared among the drug resistance profiles of different agents. At the pathway level, however, we found enrichment of immune pathways in the responders in 8 treatments within the HR+HER2+, HR+HER2-, and HR-HER2- receptor subtypes. We also found enrichment of estrogen response pathways in the non-responders in 10 treatments primarily within the hormone receptor positive subtypes. Although most of our drug predictions are unique to treatment arms and receptor subtypes, our drug repositioning pipeline identified the estrogen receptor antagonist fulvestrant as a compound that can potentially reverse resistance across 13/17 of the treatments and receptor subtypes including HR+ and triple negative. While fulvestrant showed limited efficacy when tested in a panel of 5 paclitaxel resistant breast cancer cell lines, it did increase drug response in combination with paclitaxel in HCC-1937, a triple negative breast cancer cell line. Conclusion: We applied a computational drug repurposing approach to identify potential agents to sensitize drug resistant breast cancers in the I-SPY 2 TRIAL. We identified fulvestrant as a potential drug hit and showed that it increased response in a paclitaxel-resistant triple negative breast cancer cell line, HCC-1937, when treated in combination with paclitaxel.",,,,,Open Access

Gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF2A) lead to PAH and thrombotic consequences in patients and mice. Additionally, multiple emerging studies suggest that elevated systemic arterial stiffening (SAS) occurs in PAH; this could have critical prognostic value. Here, we utilized a HIF2A GOF mouse model to determine how SAS can be used as a prognosticator in sex-divergent PAH. We analyzed survival, vascular mechanics, and vascular phenotypes in young adult (8-16 weeks) and middle age (9-12 months) Hif2a GOF mice. We find that Hif2a heterozygous (HT) female mice, but not Hif2a HT male mice, exhibit poor survival, SAS upon aging, and decreased ability to withstand repeated physiological strain. Hif2a HT female mice also display thickening of the adventitial intima and increased collagen I and collagen III in all layers of the thoracic aorta. Our findings demonstrate differing PAH progression in female and male Hif2a GOF mice. Specifically, alterations in extracellular matrix (ECM) content led to vascular stiffening in aged females, resulting in poor survival. Moreover, we show that SAS emerges early in mice with PAH by coupling studies of vascular mechanics and analyzing vascular structure and composition.

There are currently 5 U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive lung cancer in the advanced/metastatic disease setting. Despite these advances, most patients with ALK-positive lung cancer who are treated with ALK TKI therapy ultimately experience disease progression due to various mechanisms of drug resistance. In this review, we discuss strategies to address acquired therapeutic resistance to ALK inhibition, novel agents and combinatorial strategies in development for both on and off-target resistance, and some emerging approaches to prolong response to ALK inhibitors. Methods: We performed a search of peer-reviewed literature in the English language, conference abstracts, and trial registrations from the MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Elsevier), and CENTRAL (Cochrane Library) databases and major international oncology meetings up to August 2022. We then screened for studies describing interventions to overcome ALK resistance based on review of each title and abstract. Key content and findings: For patients with oligo-progression, treatment may include maintaining the same systemic treatment beyond progression while adding local therapies to progressing lesions. Strategies to combat ALK TKI resistance mediated by on-target resistance mechanisms include 4<sup>th</sup> generation TKIs (TPX-0131, NVL-655) and proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) currently in development. While for those patients who develop tumor progression due to off-target (ALK independent) resistance, options may include combination therapies targeting ALK and other downstream or parallel pathways, novel antibody drug conjugates, or combinations of ALK inhibitors with chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Lastly, other potential strategies being explored in the clinic include circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) surveillance to monitor for molecular mediators of drug resistance prior to frank progression on imaging studies and utilization of ALK TKIs in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings. Conclusions: Strategies to overcome resistance to currently available ALK inhibitors are urgently needed. Given the variety of resistance mechanisms, tailormade approaches are required for disease control.",,,,,Open Access

Tumor cells systemically change immune functions to facilitate metastatic progression. Through this study, we deciphered how tumoral galectin-1 (Gal1) expression shapes the systemic immune environment to promote metastasis in head and neck cancer (HNC). In multiple preclinical models of HNC and lung cancer in immunogenic mice, Gal1 fostered the establishment of a premetastatic niche through polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSC), which altered the local microenvironment to support metastatic spread. RNA sequencing of MDSCs from premetastatic lungs in these models demonstrated the role of PMN-MDSCs in collagen and extracellular matrix remodeling in the premetastatic compartment. Gal1 promoted MDSC accumulation in the premetastatic niche through the NF-κB signaling axis, triggering enhanced CXCL2-mediated MDSC migration. Mechanistically, Gal1 sustained NF-κB activation in tumor cells by enhancing stimulator of interferon gene (STING) protein stability, leading to prolonged inflammation-driven MDSC expansion. These findings suggest an unexpected protumoral role of STING activation in metastatic progression and establish Gal1 as an endogenous-positive regulator of STING in advanced-stage cancers.

We did this by focusing on combinations of ECMP commonly found in the developing heart with a broad goal of identifying combinations that promote maturation and influence chamber specific differentiation. We formulated 63 unique ECMP combinations fabricated from collagen 1, collagen 3, collagen 4, fibronectin, laminin, and vitronectin, presented alone and in combinations, leading to the identification of specific ECMP combinations that promote hESC proliferation, pluripotency, and germ layer specification.

Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) have been widely used for mechanistic modeling in immuno-oncology and immunotherapy. They allow rapid simulations of temporal changes in the cellular and molecular populations involved. Nonetheless, ODEs cannot describe the spatial structure in the tumor microenvironment or quantify the influence of spatially-dependent characteristics of tumor-immune dynamics. For these reasons, agent-based models (ABMs) have gained popularity because they can model more detailed phenotypic and spatial heterogeneity that better reflect the complexity seen in vivo. In the context of anti-PD-1 ICIs, we compare treatment outcomes simulated from an ODE model and an ABM to show the importance of including spatial components in computational models of cancer immunotherapy.

As researchers dig deeper into data-looking for rare cell types, subtleties of cell states, and details of gene regulatory networks-there is a growing need for algorithms with controllable accuracy and fewer ad hoc parameters and thresholds. Impeding this goal is the fact that an appropriate null distribution for scRNAseq cannot simply be extracted from data in which ground truth about biological variation is unknown (i.e., usually). Results: We approach this problem analytically, assuming that scRNAseq data reflect only cell heterogeneity (what we seek to characterize), transcriptional noise (temporal fluctuations randomly distributed across cells), and sampling error (i.e., Poisson noise). We analyze scRNAseq data without normalization-a step that skews distributions, particularly for sparse data-and calculate p values associated with key statistics. We develop an improved method for selecting features for cell clustering and identifying gene-gene correlations, both positive and negative. Using simulated data, we show that this method, which we call BigSur (Basic Informatics and Gene Statistics from Unnormalized Reads), captures even weak yet significant correlation structures in scRNAseq data. Applying BigSur to data from a clonal human melanoma cell line, we identify thousands of correlations that, when clustered without supervision into gene communities, align with known cellular components and biological processes, and highlight potentially novel cell biological relationships. Conclusions: New insights into functionally relevant gene regulatory networks can be obtained using a statistically grounded approach to the identification of gene-gene correlations.",,,,,Open Access

The pre-treatment immune make-up of the TIME is associated with treatment outcome; immunologically inflamed tumors generally exhibit better responses to radio- and immunotherapy than non-inflamed tumors. However, radiotherapy is known to induce opposing immunological consequences, resulting in both immunostimulatory and inhibitory responses. In fact, it is thought that the radiation-induced tumoricidal immune response is curtailed by subsequent applications of radiation. It is thus conceivable that spatially fractionated radiotherapy (SFRT), administered through GRID blocks (SFRT-GRID) or lattice radiotherapy to create areas of low or high dose exposure, may create protective reservoirs of the tumor immune microenvironment, thereby preserving anti-tumor immune responses that are pivotal for radiation success. Methods: We have developed an agent-based model (ABM) of tumor-immune interactions to investigate the immunological consequences and clinical outcomes after 2Gy×35 whole tumor radiation therapy (WTRT) and SFRT-GRID. The ABM is conceptually calibrated such that untreated tumors escape immune surveillance and grow to clinical detection. Individual ABM simulations are initialized from four distinct multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) slides, and immune related parameter rates are generated using Latin Hypercube Sampling. Results: In silico simulations suggest that radiation-induced cancer cell death alone is insufficient to clear a tumor with WTRT. However, explicit consideration of radiation-induced anti-tumor immunity synergizes with radiation cytotoxicity to eradicate tumors. Similarly, SFRT-GRID is successful with radiation-induced anti-tumor immunity, and, for some pre-treatment TIME compositions and modeling parameters, SFRT-GRID might be superior to WTRT in providing tumor control. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the pivotal role of the radiation-induced anti-tumor immunity. Prolonged fractionated treatment schedules may counteract early immune recruitment, which may be protected by SFRT-facilitated immune reservoirs. Different biological responses and treatment outcomes are observed based on pre-treatment TIME composition and model parameters. A rigorous analysis and model calibration for different tumor types and immune infiltration states is required before any conclusions can be drawn for clinical translation.",,,,,Open Access

It is well known that there is significant genetic heterogeneity from cell to cell in tumors, but how ECM stiffness as a parameter might interact with that genetic variation is not known. Here, we employed experimental evolution to study the response of genetically variable and clonal populations of tumor cells to variable ECM stiffness. Proliferation rates of genetically variable populations cultured on soft ECM increased over a period of several weeks, whereas clonal populations did not evolve. Tracking of DNA barcoded cell lineages revealed that soft ECM consistently selected for the same few variants. These data provide evidence that ECM stiffness exerts natural selection on genetically variable tumor populations. Soft-selected cells were highly migratory, with enriched oncogenic signatures and unusual behaviors such as spreading and traction force generation on ECMs with stiffness as low as 1 kPa. Rho-regulated cell spreading was found to be the directly selected trait, with yes-associated protein 1 translocation to the nucleus mediating fitness on soft ECM.

PDAC cells overexpress wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) that can enable them to overcome metabolic stress, suggesting it could represent a therapeutic target in PDAC. Here, we found that anti-IDH1 therapy enhanced the efficacy of conventional chemotherapeutics. Chemotherapy treatment induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased tricarboxylic acid cycle activity in PDAC cells, along with the induction of wild-type IDH1 expression as a key resistance factor. IDH1 facilitated PDAC survival following chemotherapy treatment by supporting mitochondrial function and antioxidant defense to neutralize ROS through the generation of α-ketoglutarate and NADPH, respectively. Pharmacologic inhibition of wild-type IDH1 with ivosidenib synergized with conventional chemotherapeutics in vitro and potentiated the efficacy of subtherapeutic doses of these drugs in vivo in murine PDAC models. This promising treatment approach is translatable through available and safe oral inhibitors and provides the basis of an open and accruing clinical trial testing this combination (NCT05209074).

Basal-to-inflammatory transition signature correlates with poor overall patient survival in many epithelial tumors. Basal-to-squamous cell carcinoma transition and basal-to-inflammatory transition occur in adjacent but distinct regions of a single tumor: basal-to-squamous cell carcinoma transition arises within the core tumor nodule, while basal-to-inflammatory transition emerges from a specialized inflammatory environment defined by a tumor-associated TREM1 myeloid signature.

To better understand how collagen fiber morphology influences cell-matrix interactions associated with metastasis, we used Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) images from patient biopsies with Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) as models to fabricate collagen scaffolds to investigate processes associated with motility. Using the PDAC BxPC-3 metastatic cell line, we investigated single and collective cell dynamics on scaffolds of varying collagen alignment. Collective or clustered cells grown on the scaffolds with the highest collagen fiber alignment had increased E-cadherin expression and larger focal adhesion sites compared to single cells, consistent with metastatic behavior. Analysis of single cell motility revealed that the dynamics were characterized by random walk on all substrates. However, examining collective motility over different time points showed that the migration was super-diffusive and enhanced on highly aligned fibers, whereas it was hindered and sub-diffusive on un-patterned substrates. This was further supported by the more elongated morphology observed in collectively migrating cells on aligned collagen fibers. Overall, this approach allows the decoupling of single and collective cell behavior as a function of collagen alignment and shows the relative importance of collective cell behavior as well as fiber morphology in PDAC metastasis. We suggest these scaffolds can be used for further investigations of PDAC cell biology. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a high mortality rate, where aligned collagen has been associated with poor prognosis. Biomimetic models representing this architecture are needed to understand complex cellular interactions. The SHG image-based models based on stromal collagen from human biopsies afford the measurements of cell morphology, cadherin and focal adhesion expression as well as detailed motility dynamics. Using a metastatic cell line, we decoupled the roles of single cell and collective cell behavior as well as that arising from aligned collagen. Our data suggests that metastatic characteristics are enhanced by increased collagen alignment and that collective cell behavior is more relevant to metastatic processes.

Recently, a new method based on Eshelby's theory to simultaneously assess Young's modulus (YM) and Poisson's ratio (PR) in tissues has been proposed. A significant limitation of this method is that accuracy of the reconstructed YM and PR is affected by the orientation/alignment of the tumor with the applied stress. In this paper, we propose a new method to reconstruct YM and PR in cancers that is invariant to the 3D orientation of the tumor with respect to the axis of applied stress. The novelty of the proposed method resides on the use of a tensor transformation to improve the robustness of Eshelby's theory and reconstruct YM and PR of tumors with high accuracy and in realistic experimental conditions. The method is validated using finite element simulations and controlled experiments using phantoms with known mechanical properties. The in vivo feasibility of the developed method is demonstrated in an orthotopic mouse model of breast cancer. Our results show that the proposed technique can estimate the YM and PR with overall accuracy of (97.06 ± 2.42) % under all tested tumor orientations. Animal experimental data demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology in vivo. The proposed method can significantly expand the range of applicability of the Eshelby's theory to tumors and provide new means to accurately image and quantify mechanical parameters of cancers in clinical conditions.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access

Claudins are transmembrane proteins that form the tight junction, and their expression is reduced in aggressive breast tumors. However, claudins' roles during breast cancer metastasis remain unclear. We used gain- and loss-of-function genetics in organoids isolated from murine breast cancer models to establish that Cldn7 suppresses invasion and metastasis. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Cldn7 knockdown induced smooth muscle actin (SMA)-related genes and a broader mesenchymal phenotype. We validated our results in human cell lines, fresh human tumor tissue, bulk RNA-seq, and public single-cell RNA-seq data. We consistently observed an inverse relationship between Cldn7 expression and expression of SMA-related genes. Furthermore, knockdown and overexpression of SMA-related genes demonstrated that they promote breast cancer invasion. Our data reveal that Cldn7 suppresses breast cancer invasion and metastasis through negative regulation of SMA-related and mesenchymal gene expression.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access

Existing volumetric printing techniques almost exclusively rely on light energy to trigger photopolymerization in transparent inks, limiting material choices and build sizes. We report a self-enhancing sonicated ink (or sono-ink) design and corresponding focused-ultrasound writing technique for deep-penetration acoustic volumetric printing (DAVP). We used experiments and acoustic modeling to study the frequency and scanning rate-dependent acoustic printing behaviors. DAVP achieves the key features of low acoustic streaming, rapid sonothermal polymerization, and large printing depth, enabling the printing of volumetric hydrogels and nanocomposites with various shapes regardless of their optical properties. DAVP also allows printing at centimeter depths through biological tissues, paving the way toward minimally invasive medicine.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access

The relationship between the microenvironment and pancreatic cancer is multifactorial, and age-related changes in nonmalignant cells in the tumor microenvironment may play a key role in promoting cancer aggressiveness. Because fibroblasts have profound impacts on pancreatic cancer progression, we investigated whether age-related changes in pancreatic fibroblasts influence cancer growth and metastasis. Proteomics analysis revealed that aged fibroblasts secrete different factors than young fibroblasts, including increased growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15). Treating young mice with GDF-15 enhanced tumor growth, whereas aged GDF-15 knockout mice showed reduced tumor growth. GDF-15 activated AKT, rendering tumors sensitive to AKT inhibition in an aged but not young microenvironment. These data provide evidence for how aging alters pancreatic fibroblasts and promotes tumor progression, providing potential therapeutic targets and avenues for studying pancreatic cancer while accounting for the effects of aging. Significance: Aged pancreatic fibroblasts secrete GDF-15 and activate AKT signaling to promote pancreatic cancer growth, highlighting the critical role of aging-mediated changes in the pancreatic cancer microenvironment in driving tumor progression.

However, recent studies have demonstrated that E-cadherin supports the survival and proliferation of metastatic cancer cells. Here, we identified a metabolic role for E-cadherin in breast cancer by upregulating the de novo serine synthesis pathway (SSP). The upregulated SSP provided metabolic precursors for biosynthesis and resistance to oxidative stress, enabling E-cadherin+ breast cancer cells to achieve faster tumor growth and enhanced metastases. Inhibition of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the SSP, significantly and specifically hampered proliferation of E-cadherin+ breast cancer cells and rendered them vulnerable to oxidative stress, inhibiting their metastatic potential. These findings reveal that E-cadherin reprograms cellular metabolism, promoting tumor growth and metastasis of breast cancers. Significance: E-Cadherin promotes the progression and metastasis of breast cancer by upregulating the de novo serine synthesis pathway, offering promising targets for inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis in E-cadherin-expressing tumors.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access
