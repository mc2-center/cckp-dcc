Studies of cellular responses to biomimetic soft materials have been largely restricted to hydrogels and elastomers that have stiffness values independent of time and extent of deformation, so the substrate stiffness can be unambiguously related to its effect on cells. Real tissues, however, often have loss moduli that are 10 to 20% of their elastic moduli and behave as viscoelastic solids. The response of cells to a time-dependent viscous loss is largely uncharacterized because appropriate viscoelastic materials are lacking for quantitative studies. Here we report the synthesis of soft viscoelastic solids in which the elastic and viscous moduli can be independently tuned to produce gels with viscoelastic properties that closely resemble those of soft tissues. Systematic alteration of the hydrogel viscosity demonstrates the time dependence of cellular mechanosensing and the influence of viscous dissipation on cell phenotype.","Atomic Force Microscopy, Cell Culture, Spectroscopy, Immunofluorescent Staining Method",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,29386514

Here, we investigate how populations with non-genetic fitness variation cross fitness valleys, common barriers to adaptation in rugged fitness landscapes in which a population must pass through a deleterious intermediate to arrive at a final advantageous stage. We develop a stochastic computational model describing the dynamics of an asexually reproducing population crossing a fitness valley, in which individuals of the same evolutionary stage can have variable fitnesses. We find that fitness variation that persists over multiple generations increases the rate of valley crossing through a novel evolutionary mechanism different from previously characterized mechanisms such as stochastic tunneling. By reducing the strength of selection against deleterious intermediates, persistent fitness variation allows for faster adaptation through rugged fitness landscapes.",Computational Modeling,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,30272027

Radiation therapy, the mainstay of brain tumor treatment, works by inducing DNA damage. Therefore, inhibiting DNA damage response (DDR) pathways can sensitize tumor cells to radiation and enhance cytotoxicity. AZD1390 is an inhibitor of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase, a critical regulator of DDR. Our in vivo studies in the mouse indicate that delivery of AZD1390 to the central nervous system (CNS) is restricted due to active efflux by P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The free fraction of AZD1390 in brain and spinal cord were found to be low, thereby reducing the partitioning of free drug to these organs. Coadministration of an efflux inhibitor significantly increased CNS exposure of AZD1390. No differences were observed in distribution of AZD1390 within different anatomic regions of CNS, and the functional activity of P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein also remained the same across brain regions. In an intracranial GBM patient-derived xenograft model, AZD1390 accumulation was higher in the tumor core and rim compared with surrounding brain. Despite this heterogenous delivery within tumor-bearing brain, AZD1390 concentrations in normal brain, tumor rim, and tumor core were above in vitro effective radiosensitizing concentrations. These results indicate that despite being a substrate of efflux in the mouse brain, sufficient AZD1390 exposure is anticipated even in regions of normal brain. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Given the invasive nature of glioblastoma (GBM), tumor cells are often protected by an intact blood-brain barrier, requiring the development of brain-penetrant molecules for effective treatment. We show that efflux mediated by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) limits central nervous system (CNS) distribution of AZD1390 and that there are no distributional differences within anatomical regions of CNS. Despite efflux by P-gp, concentrations effective for potent radiosensitization are achieved in GBM tumor-bearing mouse brains, indicating that AZD1390 is an attractive molecule for clinical development of brain tumors.","Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry, Modeling, Statistical Modeling",Glioblastoma,Brain,Not Applicable,Open Access,36137710

Alisertib, an aurora A kinase inhibitor, has been examined for treatment of several CNS tumors in preclinical and clinical studies. In this study, we investigated the distribution of alisertib into the CNS, the site of efficacy for brain tumors, and into the bone marrow, the site of dose-limiting toxicity leading to myelosuppression. Mechanisms influencing site-specific distribution, such as active transport mediated by the efflux proteins, p-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp), were examined. Alisertib exposure to the brain in wild-type mice was less than 1% of that in the plasma, and was evenly distributed throughout various brain regions and the spinal cord. Studies using transporter knockout mice and pharmacological inhibition show that alisertib CNS distribution is influenced by P-gp, but not Bcrp. Conversely, upon systemic administration, alisertib distribution to the bone marrow occurred rapidly, was not significantly limited by efflux transporters, and reached higher concentrations than in the CNS. This study demonstrates that, given an equivalent distributional driving force exposure in plasma, the exposure of alisertib in the brain is significantly less than that in the bone marrow, suggesting that targeted delivery may be necessary to guarantee therapeutic efficacy with minimal risk for adverse events.Therefore, these data suggest that, to improve the therapeutic index when using alisertib for brain tumors, a localized regional delivery, such as convection-enhanced delivery, may be warranted. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The CNS penetration of alisertib is limited with uniform distribution in various regions of the brain, and P-gp efflux is an important mechanism limiting that CNS distribution. Alisertib rapidly distributes into the bone marrow, a site of toxicity, with a greater exposure than in the CNS, a possible site of efficacy. These results suggest a need to design localized delivery strategies to improve the CNS exposure of alisertib and limit systemic toxicities in the treatment of brain tumors.","Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry, Modeling",Brain Neoplasm,Brain,Not Applicable,Open Access,36279392

Here we develop a study based on correlating the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained biopsy data with MALDI mass-spectrometric imaging data of the corresponding tissue to determine the cancerous regions and their unique chemical signatures and variations of the predicted regions with original pathological annotations. We obtain features from high-resolution optical micrographs of whole slide H&E stained data through deep learning and spatially register them with mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) data to correlate the chemical signature with the tissue anatomy of the data. We then use the learned correlation to predict prostate cancer from observed H&E images using trained coregistered MSI data. This multimodal approach can predict cancerous regions with ∼80% accuracy, which indicates a correlation between optical H&E features and chemical information found in MSI. We show that such paired multimodal data can be used for training feature extraction networks on H&E data which bypasses the need to acquire expensive MSI data and eliminates the need for manual annotation saving valuable time. Two chemical biomarkers were also found to be predicting the ground truth cancerous regions. This study shows promise in generating improved patient treatment trajectories by predicting prostate cancer directly from readily available H&E-stained biopsy images aided by coregistered MSI data.","Deep Learning, Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method, MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry",Prostate Neoplasm,Prostate Gland,Not Applicable,Open Access,36625762

Given the small numbers of patients with relapsed AML and historical logistical barriers to international collaboration including poor trial funding and drug availability, the management of AML relapse has varied among pediatric oncology cooperative groups with several salvage regimens utilized and a lack of universally defined response criteria. The landscape of relapsed pediatric AML treatment is changing rapidly, however, as the international AML community harnesses collective knowledge and resources to characterize the genetic and immunophenotypic heterogeneity of relapsed disease, identify biological targets of interest within specific AML subtypes, develop new precision medicine approaches for collaborative investigation in early-phase clinical trials, and tackle challenges of universal drug access across the globe. This review provides a comprehensive overview of progress achieved to date in the treatment of pediatric patients with relapsed AML and highlights modern, state-of-the-art therapeutic approaches under active and emerging clinical investigation that have been facilitated by international collaboration among academic pediatric oncologists, laboratory scientists, regulatory agencies, pharmaceutical partners, cancer research sponsors, and patient advocates.","Immunotherapy, Next Generation Sequencing",Acute Myeloid Leukemia,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,36861399

Applications for this device are broad, ranging from answering basic biological questions to clinical pathology, where immunofluorescence can detect a larger number of markers than the standard H&E or chromogenic immunohistochemistry (CIH) staining, while the low cost also allows usage in classrooms. After characterizing our platform's specificity and sensitivity, we demonstrate imaging of a 4-plex immunology panel in human cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples. From those images, positive cells were detected using CellProfiler, a popular open-source software package, for tumor marker profiling. We achieved a performance on par with commercial epifluorescence microscopes that are >10 times more expensive than our Tissue Imager. This device enables rapid immunofluorescence detection in tissue sections at a low cost for scientists and clinicians and can provide students with a hands-on experience to understand engineering and instrumentation.

As macrophages efficiently localize to the TME, we hypothesized that they could be used as a delivery vehicle for drugs designed to block this pathway. To test our hypothesis, we created and evaluated genetically engineered macrophages (GEMs) that produce an IL-10-blocking antibody (αIL-10). Healthy donor human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were differentiated and transduced with a novel lentivirus (LV) encoding BT-063, a humanized αIL-10 antibody. The efficacy of αIL-10 GEMs was assessed in human gastrointestinal tumor slice culture models developed from resected specimens of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma primary tumors and colorectal cancer liver metastases. LV transduction led to sustained production of BT-063 by αIL-10 GEMs for at least 21 days. Transduction did not alter GEM phenotype as evaluated by flow cytometry, but αIL-10 GEMs produced measurable quantities of BT-063 in the TME that was associated with an ~5-fold higher rate of tumor cell apoptosis than control.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Restricted Access,37296315

The micropillars impacted nuclear architecture, lamin A/C multimerization and 3D chromatin conformation, and the ensuing transcriptional reprogramming enhanced the cells' responsiveness to osteogenic differentiation factors and decreased their plasticity and off-target differentiation.

This knowledge gap presents a significant barrier to designing HA hydrogels with predictable bioactivities. As HA has been widely reported to have molecular weight-dependent effects on endothelial cells (ECs), we investigated how the molecular weight of HA in either soluble or crosslinked forms affects angiogenesis and interrogated CD44 clustering on the surface of endothelial cells as a candidate mechanism for these affects. Using soluble HA, our results show high molecular weight (HMW) HA, but not low molecular weight (LMW) HA, increased viability and tube formation in cultured human cerebral microvascular ECs (HCMVECs). No size of HA affected proliferation. When HCMVECs were cultured with crosslinked HA of varying molecular weights in the form of HA-based microporous annealed particle scaffold (HMAPS), the cell response was comparable to when cultured with soluble HA. Similarly, when implanted subcutaneously, HMAPS with HMW HA were more vascularized than those with LMW HA. We also show that antibody-mediated CD44 clustering resulted in HCMVECs with increased viability and tube-like structure formation in a manner comparable to exposure to HMW HA, suggesting that HMW acts through CD44 clustering. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Biomaterials based on hyaluronic acid (HA), a bioactive extracellular matrix polysaccharide, have been used in clinical products for several years. Despite the knowledge that HA molecular weight heavily influences its bioactivity, molecular weight has been largely ignored in the development of HA-based biomaterials. Given the high viscosity of high molecular weight HA typically found in native tissues, lower molecular weight polysaccharides have been used most commonly for biomaterial fabrication. By comparing the ability of injectable, microporous annealed particle scaffolds (MAPS) fabricated from variably sized HA to promote angiogenesis, this study demonstrates that MAPS with high molecular weight HA better support vascularization, likely through an unique ability to induce clustering of CD44 receptors on endothelial cells.","Cell Culture, Hydrogels, Microfluidics",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,37572983

During B-cell activation and Epstein-Barr virus infection, redirection of splicing from V1 to V3 coincided with increased CD20 positivity. Similarly, in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma only V3, but not V1, correlated with CD20 protein levels, suggesting that V1 might be translation-deficient. Indeed, the longer V1 isoform was found to contain upstream open reading frames (uORFs) and a stem-loop structure, which cooperatively inhibited polysome recruitment. By modulating CD20 isoforms with splice-switching Morpholino oligomers, we enhanced CD20 expression and anti-CD20 antibody rituximab-mediated cytotoxicity in a panel of B-cell lines. Furthermore, reconstitution of CD20-knockout cells with V3 mRNA led to the recovery of CD20 positivity, while V1-reconstituted cells had undetectable levels of CD20 protein. Surprisingly, in vitro CD20-directed CAR T cells were able to kill both V3- and V1-expressing cells, but the bispecific T cell engager mosunetuzumab was only effective against V3-expressing cells. To determine whether CD20 splicing is involved in immunotherapy resistance, we performed RNA-seq on four post-mosunetuzumab follicular lymphoma relapses and discovered that in two of them downregulation of CD20 was accompanied by the V3-to-V1 shift. Thus, splicing-mediated mechanisms of epitope loss extend to CD20-directed immunotherapies.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Restricted Access,37683180

Recent experimental evidence suggests that post-therapy PACC-derived recurrent populations display cross-resistance to classes of therapies with independent mechanisms of action. We hypothesize that this can occur through PACC memory, whereby cancer cells that have undergone a polyaneuploid transition (PAT) reenter the PACC state more quickly or have higher levels of innate resistance. In this paper, we build on our prior mathematical models of the eco-evolutionary dynamics of cells in the 2N+ and PACC states to investigate these two hypotheses. We show that although an increase in innate resistance is more effective at promoting cross-resistance, this trend can also be produced via PACC memory. We also find that resensitization of cells that acquire increased innate resistance through the PAT have a considerable impact on eco-evolutionary dynamics and extinction probabilities.

Take Precision Medicine of cancer as an example, in which the goal is to match patients with treatments based on molecular markers identified in each patient's tumor. A substantial challenge, however, is that the molecular markers can vary significantly at different spatial locations of a tumor. If this spatial distribution could be predicted, the precision of cancer treatment could be greatly improved by adapting treatment to the spatial molecular heterogeneity. This is a challenging task because no technology is available to measure the molecular markers at each spatial location within a tumor. Biopsy samples provide direct measurement, but they are scarce/local. Imaging, such as MRI, is global, but it only provides proxy/indirect measurement. Also available are mechanistic models or domain knowledge, which are often approximate or incomplete. This paper proposes a novel machine learning framework to fuse the three sources of data/information to generate spatial prediction, namely the knowledge-infused global-local data fusion (KGL) model. A novel mathematical formulation is proposed and solved with theoretical study. We present a real-data application of predicting the spatial distribution of Tumor Cell Density (TCD)-an important molecular marker for brain cancer. A total of 82 biopsy samples were acquired from 18 patients with glioblastoma, together with 6 MRI contrast images from each patient and biological knowledge encoded by a PDE simulator-based mechanistic model called Proliferation-Invasion (PI). KGL achieved the highest prediction accuracy and minimum prediction uncertainty compared with a variety of competing methods. The result has important implications for providing individualized, spatially-optimized treatment for each patient.","Mathematical Modeling, Computational Modeling",Glioblastoma,Brain,Not Applicable,Open Access,37700873

Alterations to polarity, including an apical-out polarity, occur in human cancers. Although some aberrant polarity states may result from altered protein trafficking, recent observations of an extraordinary tissue-level inside-out unfolding suggest an alternative pathway for altered polarity. Because mechanical alterations are common in human cancer, including an upregulation of RhoA-mediated actomyosin tension in acinar epithelia, we explored whether perturbing mechanical homeostasis could cause apical-out eversion. Acinar eversion was robustly induced by direct activation of RhoA in normal and tumor epithelial acini, or indirect activation of RhoA through blockage of β1-integrins, disruption of the LINC complex, oncogenic Ras activation, or Rac1 inhibition. Furthermore, laser ablation of a portion of the untreated acinus was sufficient to induce eversion. Analyses of acini revealed high curvature and low phosphorylated myosin in the apical cell surfaces relative to the basal surfaces. A vertex-based mathematical model that balances tension at cell-cell interfaces revealed a fivefold greater basal cell surface tension relative to the apical cell surface tension.

Using the MC model to simulate SMLM images, we first optimized our clustering algorithm to separate >10<sup>6</sup> molecular localizations of fluorescently labeled NPC proteins into hundreds of individual NPCs in each cell. We then illustrated using our MC model to generate cellular substructures with different angles of labeling to inform our structural understanding through the SMLM images obtained.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,37463268

There is a compelling need to understand the effects, safety thresholds, and mechanisms of radiation damage in human tissues, in order to develop measures for radiation protection during extended space travel. As animal models fail to recapitulate the molecular changes in astronauts, engineered human tissues and ""organs-on-chips"" are valuable tools for studying effects of radiation in vitro. We have developed a bioengineered tissue platform for studying radiation damage in individualized settings. To demonstrate its utility, we determined the effects of radiation using engineered models of two human tissues known to be radiosensitive: engineered cardiac tissues (eCT, a target of chronic radiation damage) and engineered bone marrow (eBM, a target of acute radiation damage). We report the effects of high-dose neutrons, a proxy for simulated galactic cosmic rays, on the expression of key genes implicated in tissue responses to ionizing radiation, phenotypic and functional changes in both tissues, and proof-of-principle application of radioprotective agents. We further determined the extent of inflammatory, oxidative stress, and matrix remodeling gene expression changes, and found that these changes were associated with an early hypertrophic phenotype in eCT and myeloid skewing in eBM. We propose that individualized models of human tissues have potential to provide insights into the effects and mechanisms of radiation during deep-space missions and allow testing of radioprotective measures.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,37633022

Each modality leads to unique treatment outcomes by interacting with the tumor microenvironment (TME), which imposes a fundamental selective pressure on cancer progression. The advent of single-cell profiling technologies has revolutionized our understanding of the intricate and heterogeneous nature of the TME at an unprecedented resolution. This review delves into the commonalities and differential manifestations of how cancer therapies reshape the microenvironment in diverse cancer types. We highlight how groundbreaking immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) strategies alone or in combination with tumor-targeting treatments are endowed with comprehensive mechanistic insights when decoded at the single-cell level, aiming to drive forward future research directions on personalized treatments.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,37658004

CRTs require fitting a large number of predictive models, which is often computationally intractable. Existing solutions to reduce the cost of CRTs typically split the dataset into a train and test portion, or rely on heuristics for interactions, both of which lead to a loss in power. We propose the decoupled independence test (DIET), an algorithm that avoids both of these issues by leveraging marginal independence statistics to test conditional independence relationships. DIET tests the marginal independence of two random variables: Fx∣z(x∣z) and Fy∣z(y∣z) where F⋅∣z(⋅∣z) is a conditional cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the distribution p(⋅∣z). These variables are termed ""information residuals."" We give sufficient conditions for DIET to achieve finite sample type-1 error control and power greater than the type-1 error rate. We then prove that when using the mutual information between the information residuals as a test statistic, DIET yields the most powerful conditionally valid test. Finally, we show DIET achieves higher power than other tractable CRTs on several synthetic and real benchmarks.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,37681192
