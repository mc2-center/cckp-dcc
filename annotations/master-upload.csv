Moreover, epigenomic alterations can now be measured at multiple scales of analysis and are detectable in human tumors or liquid biopsies. Malignant cell clones with a proclivity for relapse in certain organs may arise in the primary tumor as a consequence of epigenomic alterations which cause a loss in lineage integrity. These alterations may occur due to genetic aberrations acquired during tumor progression or concomitant to therapeutic response. Moreover, evolution of the stroma can also alter the epigenome of cancer cells. In this review, we highlight current knowledge with a particular emphasis on leveraging chromatin and DNA modifying mechanisms as biomarkers of disseminated disease and as therapeutic targets to treat metastatic cancers.",Targeted Therapy Agent,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Appicable,Open Access,,,,37286865

While mapping these relationships between TFs is important for understanding their context-specific functions, existing approaches either rely on DNA binding motif predictions, interrogate one TF at a time, or study individual TFs in parallel. Here, we introduce paired yeast one-hybrid (pY1H) assays to detect cooperativity and antagonism across hundreds of TF-pairs at DNA regions of interest. We provide evidence that a wide variety of TFs are subject to modulation by other TFs in a DNA region-specific manner. We also demonstrate that TF-TF relationships are often affected by alternative isoform usage and identify cooperativity and antagonism between human TFs and viral proteins from human papillomaviruses, Epstein-Barr virus, and other viruses. Altogether, pY1H assays provide a broadly applicable framework to study how different functional relationships affect protein occupancy at regulatory DNA regions.","DNA Sequencing, ChIP-Seq",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,PRJNA1015222,Open Access,,,,37853017

Here, we used a systems biology approach to compare metabolic fluxes used by parental breast cancer cells and their brain- and lung-homing derivatives. Divergent lineages had distinct, heritable metabolic fluxes. Lung-homing cells maintained high glycolytic flux despite low levels of glycolytic intermediates, constitutively activating a pathway sink into lactate. This strong Warburg effect was associated with a high ratio of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) expression, which correlated with lung metastasis in patients with breast cancer. Although feature classification models trained on clinical characteristics alone were unable to predict tropism, the LDH/PDH ratio was a significant predictor of metastasis to the lung but not to other organs, independent of other transcriptomic signatures. High lactate efflux was also a trait in lung-homing metastatic pancreatic cancer cells, suggesting that lactate production may be a convergent phenotype in lung metastasis. Together, these analyses highlight the essential role that metabolism plays in organ-specific cancer metastasis and identify a putative biomarker for predicting lung metastasis in patients with breast cancer. Significance: Lung-homing metastatic breast cancer cells express an elevated ratio of lactate dehydrogenase to pyruvate dehydrogenase, indicating that ratios of specific metabolic gene transcripts have potential as metabolic biomarkers for predicting organ-specific metastasis.","Cell Culture, ELISA, Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry",Breast Neoplasm,Not Applicable,Not Appicable,Open Access,,,,37526524

Cancer vaccines require the addition of immunostimulatory adjuvants to increase vaccine immunogenicity, and increasingly multiple adjuvants are used in combination to bolster further and shape cellular immunity to tumor antigens. However, rigorous quantification of adjuvants' synergistic interactions is challenging due to partial redundancy in costimulatory molecules and cytokine production, leading to the common assumption that combining both adjuvants at the maximum tolerated dose results in optimal efficacy. Herein, we examine this maximum dose assumption and find combinations of these doses are suboptimal. Instead, we optimized dendritic cell activation by extending the Multidimensional Synergy of Combinations (MuSyC) framework that measures the synergy of efficacy and potency between two vaccine adjuvants. Initially, we performed a preliminary <i>in vitro</i> screening of clinically translatable adjuvant receptor targets (TLR, STING, NLL, and RIG-I). We determined that STING agonist (CDN) plus TLR4 agonist (MPL-A) or TLR7/8 agonist (R848) as the best pairwise combinations for dendritic cell activation. In addition, we found that the combination of R848 and CDN is synergistically efficacious and potent in activating both murine and human antigen-presenting cells (APCs) <i>in vitro</i>. These two selected adjuvants were then used to estimate a MuSyC-dose optimized for <i>in vivo</i> T-cell priming using ovalbumin-based peptide vaccines. Finally, using B16 melanoma and MOC1 head and neck cancer models, MuSyC-dose-based adjuvating of cancer vaccines improved the antitumor response, increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and induced novel myeloid tumor infiltration changes. Further, the MuSyC-dose-based adjuvants approach did not cause additional weight changes or increased plasma cytokine levels compared to CDN alone. Collectively, our findings offer a proof of principle that our MuSyC-extended approach can be used to optimize cancer vaccine formulations for immunotherapy.","Flow Cytometry, In Vitro Cell Killing Assay","Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Melanoma, Acute Monocytic Leukemia",Not Applicable,Not Appicable,Open Access,,,,36059502

Here, we took a structure-based approach to decoupling IFNŒ≥ pleiotropy. We engineered an affinity-enhanced variant of the ligand-binding chain of the IFNŒ≥ receptor IFNŒ≥R1, which enabled us to determine the crystal structure of the complete hexameric (2:2:2) IFNŒ≥-IFNŒ≥R1-IFNŒ≥R2 signalling complex at 3.25¬†√Ö resolution.

The topology of the hexameric complex offers a blueprint for engineering IFNŒ≥ variants to tune IFNŒ≥ receptor signalling output. Unexpectedly, we found that several partial IFNŒ≥ agonists exhibited biased gene-expression profiles. These biased agonists retained the ability to induce upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class I antigen expression, but exhibited impaired induction of programmed death-ligand 1 expression in a wide range of human cancer cell lines, offering a route to decoupling immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive functions of IFNŒ≥ for therapeutic applications.","Mass Spectrometry, Next Generation Sequencing, Surface Plasmon Resonance",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,GSE122672,Open Access,,,,30814731

One factor known to contribute to the poor chemotherapy response is the poor drug diffusion into PDAC tumors. Novel treatment methods are therefore drastically needed to improve targeted delivery of treatments. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of the 3DNA¬Æ Nanocarrier (3DNA) platform to direct delivery of therapeutics to PDAC tumors in vivo. Materials and methods: A panel of PDAC cell lines and a patient tissue microarray were screened for established tumor-specific proteins to identify targeting moieties for active targeting of the 3DNA. NRG mice with or without orthotopic MIA PaCa-2-luciferase PDAC tumors were treated intraperitoneally with 100 Œºl of fluorescently labeled 3DNA. Results: Folic acid and transferrin receptors were significantly elevated in PDAC compared to normal pancreas. Accordingly, both folic acid- and transferrin-conjugated 3DNA treatments significantly increased delivery of 3DNA specifically to tumors in comparison to unconjugated 3DNA treatment. In the absence of tumors, there was an increased clearance of both folic acid-conjugated 3DNA and unconjugated 3DNA, compared to the clearance rate in tumor-bearing mice. Lastly, delivery of siLuciferase by folic acid-conjugated 3DNA in an orthotopic model of luciferase-expressing PDAC showed significant and prolonged suppression of luciferase protein expression and activity.

Current dogma states that McSCs are reserved in an undifferentiated state in the hair follicle niche, physically segregated from differentiated progeny that migrate away following cues of regenerative stimuli<sup>4-8</sup>. Here we show that most McSCs toggle between transit-amplifying and stem cell states for both self-renewal and generation of mature progeny, a mechanism fundamentally distinct from those of other self-renewing systems. Live imaging and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that McSCs are mobile, translocating between hair follicle stem cell and transit-amplifying compartments where they reversibly enter distinct differentiation states governed by local microenvironmental cues (for example, WNT). Long-term lineage tracing demonstrated that the McSC system is maintained by reverted McSCs rather than by reserved stem cells inherently exempt from reversible changes. During ageing, there is accumulation of stranded McSCs that do not contribute to the regeneration of melanocyte progeny. These results identify a new model whereby dedifferentiation is integral to homeostatic stem cell maintenance and suggest that modulating McSC mobility may represent a new approach for the prevention of hair greying.","Imaging, Immunofluorescent Staining Method, In Situ Hybridization, Microscopy, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis",Melanoma,Skin,"GSE203051,  GSE113502",Open Access,,,,37076619

Although circulating adaptive and innate lymphocyte effector responses are required for effective antimetastatic immunity, whether tissue-resident immune circuits confer initial immunity at sites of metastatic dissemination remains ill defined. Here we examine the nature of local immune cell responses during early metastatic seeding in the lung using intracardiac injection to mimic monodispersed metastatic spread. Using syngeneic murine melanoma and colon cancer models, we demonstrate that lung-resident conventional type 2 dendritic cells (DC2) orchestrate a local immune circuit to confer host antimetastatic immunity. Tissue-specific ablation of lung DC2, and not peripheral DC populations, led to increased metastatic burden in the presence of an intact T cell and NK cell compartment. We demonstrate that DC nucleic acid sensing and transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7 signaling are required for early metastatic control and that DC2 serve as a robust source of proinflammatory cytokines in the lung. Critically, DC2 direct the local production of IFN-Œ≥ by lung-resident NK cells, which limits the initial metastatic burden.

However, the approach remains challenging, with blockade of the macrophage checkpoint CD47 working in immunodeficient mice and against highly immunogenic tumors but not in the clinic where tumors are poorly immunogenic. Even when mouse tumors of poorly immunogenic B16F10 melanoma are opsonized to drive engulfment with a suitable monoclonal antibody (mAb), anti-CD47 blockade remains insufficient. Using both in vitro immuno-tumoroids and in vivo mouse models, we show with CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) that a relatively uniform minimum repression of CD47 by 80% is needed for phagocytosis to dominate net growth when combined with an otherwise ineffective mAb (anti-Tyrp1). Heterogeneity enriches for CD47-high cells, but mice that eliminate tumors generate prophagocytic IgGs that increase in titer with CD47 repression and with tumor accumulation of macrophages, although deeper repression does not improve survival. Given well-known limitations of antibody permeation into solid tumors, our studies clarify benchmarks for CD47 disruption that should be more clinically feasible and safer but just as effective as complete ablation.

Expansion of the poly(Q) track within AR IDR results in a higher AR condensation propensity as measured by multiple methods, including live-cell single-molecule microscopy.

No significant changes in nuclear pore numbers were detected using three independent NUP antibodies; however, NUP reduction in other subcellular compartments such as the cytoplasm was identified. To investigate how NUP reduction influences keratinocyte differentiation, we knocked down NUP93 in keratinocytes in the progenitor-state culture condition. NUP93 knockdown diminished keratinocytes' clonogenicity and epidermal regenerative capacity, without drastically affecting nuclear pore numbers or permeability. Using transcriptome profiling, we identified that NUP93 knockdown induces differentiation genes related to both mechanical and immune barrier functions, including the activation of known NF-Œ∫B target genes. Consistently, keratinocytes with NUP93 knockdown exhibited increased nuclear localization of the NF-Œ∫B p65/p50 transcription factors, and increased NF-Œ∫B reporter activity.

For each patient, DIR between the portal and venous (PV) phase of a diagnostic computed tomography (CT) scan acquired before radiation therapy (RT) planning, and a PV phase of a diagnostic CT scan acquired after the end of RT (on average 147 ¬± 36 d) was performed to calculate Jacobian maps representing volume changes in the liver. These volume change maps were used: (i): to analyze the dose/volume relationship in the whole liver and individual Couinaud's segments; and (ii): to investigate the use of deep-learning to predict a Jacobian map solely based on the pre-RT diagnostic CT and planned dose distribution. Moderate correlations between mean equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2) and volume change was observed for all liver sub-regions analyzed individually with Pearson correlation<i>r</i>ranging from -0.36 to -067. The predicted volume change maps showed a significantly stronger voxel-wise correlation with the DIR-based volume change maps than when considering the original EQD2 distribution (0.63 ¬± 0.24 versus 0.55 ¬± 23, respectively), demonstrating the ability of the proposed approach to establish complex relationships between planned dose and liver volume response months after treatment, which represents a promising prediction tool for the development of future adaptive and personalized liver radiation therapy strategies.","Computed Tomography, Deep Learning",Hepatocellular Carcinoma,Liver,Not Applicable,Open Access,,,,37714187

However, recreating the dynamic functional properties inherent to natural systems remains challenging. Here we report the discovery of a short peptide based on the tryptophan zipper (trpzip) motif, that shows multiscale hierarchical ordering that leads to emergent dynamic properties. Trpzip hydrogels are antimicrobial and self-healing, with tunable viscoelasticity and unique yield-stress properties that allow immediate harvest of embedded cells through a flick of the wrist. This characteristic makes Trpzip hydrogels amenable to syringe extrusion, which we demonstrate with examples of cell delivery and bioprinting. Trpzip hydrogels display innate bioactivity, allowing propagation of human intestinal organoids with apical-basal polarization. Considering these extensive attributes, we anticipate the Trpzip motif will prove a versatile building block for supramolecular assembly of soft materials for biotechnology and medicine.","Hydrogels, Transmission Electron Microscopy, Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, Cryo-Electron Microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Organoid, Cell Viability Assay, 3D Bioprinting",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,PXD038870,Open Access,,,,37872151

Based on the modus operandi established in the early days of chemotherapies, most drugs are administered according to predetermined schedules that seek to deliver the maximum tolerated dose and are only adjusted for toxicity. However, we believe that the complex, evolving nature of cancer requires a more dynamic and personalized approach. Chronicling the milestones of the field, we show that the impact of schedule choice crucially depends on processes driving treatment response and failure. As such, cancer heterogeneity and evolution dictate that a one-size-fits-all solution is unlikely-instead, each patient should be mapped to the strategy that best matches their current disease characteristics and treatment objectives (i.e. their 'tumorscape'). To achieve this level of personalization, we need mathematical modeling. In this perspective, we propose a five-step 'Adaptive Dosing Adjusted for Personalized Tumorscapes (ADAPT)' paradigm to integrate data and understanding across scales and derive dynamic and personalized schedules.

Increased glucose metabolism in response to stimulation is accompanied by mobilization of endogenous inosine into pentose phosphates via the action of purine nucleotide phosphorylase (PNP).

The VMT forms de novo within a microfluidic platform by co-culture of multiple human cell types under dynamic, physiological flow conditions. This tissue-engineered micro-tumor construct incorporates a living perfused vascular network that supports the growing tumor mass just as newly formed vessels do in vivo. Importantly, drugs and immune cells must cross the endothelial layer to reach the tumor, modeling in vivo physiological barriers to therapeutic delivery and efficacy. Since the VMT platform is optically transparent, high-resolution imaging of dynamic processes such as immune cell extravasation and metastasis can be achieved with direct visualization of fluorescently labeled cells within the tissue. Further, the VMT retains in vivo tumor heterogeneity, gene expression signatures, and drug responses. Virtually any tumor type can be adapted to the platform, and primary cells from fresh surgical tissues grow and respond to drug treatment in the VMT, paving the way toward truly personalized medicine.

Somatic heterozygous missense mutations in the SPOP1 substrate-binding cleft are found in up to 15% of prostate cancers. While mutations in SPOP predict for benefit from androgen receptor signaling inhibition (ARSi) therapy, outcomes for patients with SPOP-mutant (SPOPmut) prostate cancer are heterogeneous and targeted treatments for SPOPmut castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) are lacking. Experimental design: Using in silico genomic and transcriptomic tumor data, proteomics analysis and genetically modified cell line models we demonstrate mechanistic links between SPOP mutations, STING signaling alterations and PARP inhibitor vulnerabilities. Results: We demonstrate that SPOP mutations are associated with upregulation of a 29-gene non-canonical (NC) STING1 (NC-STING) signature in a subset of SPOPmut, treatment-refractory CRPC patients. We show in preclinical CRPC models that SPOP targets and destabilizes STING protein, and prostate cancer Ã∂ associated SPOP mutations result in upregulated NC-STING-NF-Œ∫B signaling and macrophage- and tumor microenvironment (TME)-facilitated reprogramming, leading to tumor cell growth.

Conclusions: We provide evidence that SPOP is critical in regulating immunosuppressive versus anti-tumor activity downstream of DNA damage-induced STING activation in prostate cancer.

Real tissues, however, often have loss moduli that are 10 to 20% of their elastic moduli and behave as viscoelastic solids. The response of cells to a time-dependent viscous loss is largely uncharacterized because appropriate viscoelastic materials are lacking for quantitative studies.

We develop a stochastic computational model describing the dynamics of an asexually reproducing population crossing a fitness valley, in which individuals of the same evolutionary stage can have variable fitnesses. We find that fitness variation that persists over multiple generations increases the rate of valley crossing through a novel evolutionary mechanism different from previously characterized mechanisms such as stochastic tunneling.

We show that although an increase in innate resistance is more effective at promoting cross-resistance, this trend can also be produced via PACC memory. We also find that resensitization of cells that acquire increased innate resistance through the PAT have a considerable impact on eco-evolutionary dynamics and extinction probabilities. This study, though theoretical in nature, can help inspire future experimentation to tease apart hypotheses surrounding how cross-resistance in structured cancer populations arises.",Mathematical Modeling,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,,,,37700000

Alterations to polarity, including an apical-out polarity, occur in human cancers. Although some aberrant polarity states may result from altered protein trafficking, recent observations of an extraordinary tissue-level inside-out unfolding suggest an alternative pathway for altered polarity. Because mechanical alterations are common in human cancer, including an upregulation of RhoA-mediated actomyosin tension in acinar epithelia, we explored whether perturbing mechanical homeostasis could cause apical-out eversion. Acinar eversion was robustly induced by direct activation of RhoA in normal and tumor epithelial acini, or indirect activation of RhoA through blockage of β1-integrins, disruption of the LINC complex, oncogenic Ras activation, or Rac1 inhibition. Furthermore, laser ablation of a portion of the untreated acinus was sufficient to induce eversion. Analyses of acini revealed high curvature and low phosphorylated myosin in the apical cell surfaces relative to the basal surfaces. A vertex-based mathematical model that balances tension at cell-cell interfaces revealed a fivefold greater basal cell surface tension relative to the apical cell surface tension. The model suggests that the difference in surface energy between the apical and basal surfaces is the driving force for acinar eversion.

The explicit number of isomers as a function of size is computed using a graph theoretic approach that is compared to a direct count for smaller systems. This allows us to apply a common approach to both nanosystems and their macroscopic limit. The entropy increases very rapidly with size with the results that replacing the actual distribution over size by an average is not an accurate approximation. That the phase transition is a sharp function of the temperature is due to the high heat capacity of both the solid and liquid phases. The difference in entropy at the transition is related to the Trouton-Richards considerations. The finite width of the boundary between two phases of a finite system is related to the inherent uncertainty product that is derived from the maximum entropy formalism and that is a result of the fluctuations about equilibrium.

In particular, complex biophysical mechanisms enable a tumor to remodel the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), allowing cells to invade alone or collectively. Tumor spheroids cultured in collagen represent a simplified, reproducible 3D model system, which is sufficiently complex to recapitulate the evolving organization of cells and interaction with the ECM that occur during invasion. Recent experimental approaches enable high resolution imaging and quantification of the internal structure of invading tumor spheroids. Concurrently, computational modeling enables simulations of complex multicellular aggregates based on first principles. The comparison between real and simulated spheroids represents a way to fully exploit both data sources, but remains a challenge. We hypothesize that comparing any two spheroids requires first the extraction of basic features from the raw data, and second the definition of key metrics to match such features. Here, we present a novel method to compare spatial features of spheroids in 3D. To do so, we define and extract features from spheroid point cloud data, which we simulated using Cells in Silico (CiS), a high-performance framework for large-scale tissue modeling previously developed by us. We then define metrics to compare features between individual spheroids, and combine all metrics into an overall deviation score. Finally, we use our features to compare experimental data on invading spheroids in increasing collagen densities. We propose that our approach represents the basis for defining improved metrics to compare large 3D data sets. Moving forward, this approach will enable the detailed analysis of spheroids of any origin, one application of which is informing in silico spheroids based on their in vitro counterparts.

Here, we study interactions between estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell lineages that are sensitive and resistant to ribociclib-induced cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibition. In mono- and coculture, we find that sensitive cells grow and compete more effectively in the absence of treatment. During treatment with ribociclib, sensitive cells survive and proliferate better when grown together with resistant cells than when grown in monoculture, termed facilitation in ecology. Molecular, protein, and genomic analyses show that resistant cells increase metabolism and production of estradiol, a highly active estrogen metabolite, and increase estrogen signaling in sensitive cells to promote facilitation in coculture. Adding estradiol in monoculture provides sensitive cells with increased resistance to therapy and cancels facilitation in coculture. Under partial inhibition of estrogen signaling through low-dose endocrine therapy, estradiol supplied by resistant cells facilitates sensitive cell growth. However, a more complete blockade of estrogen signaling, through higher-dose endocrine therapy, diminished the facilitative growth of sensitive cells.

Previous models have elucidated interactions between EGFR and downstream adaptor proteins or showed phenotypes affected by EGFR. However, the link between specific EGFR phosphorylation sites and phenotypic outcomes is still poorly understood. Here, we employed a suite of isogenic cell lines expressing site-specific mutations at each of the EGFR C-terminal phosphorylation sites to interrogate their role in the signaling network and cell biological response to stimulation. Our results demonstrate the resilience of the EGFR network, which was largely similar even in the context of multiple Y-to-F mutations in the EGFR C-terminal tail, while also revealing nodes in the network that have not previously been linked to EGFR signaling. Our data-driven model highlights the signaling network nodes associated with distinct EGF-driven cell responses, including migration, proliferation, and receptor trafficking. Application of this same approach to less-studied RTKs should provide a plethora of novel associations that should lead to an improved understanding of these signaling networks.","Plasmid Construction, Flow Cytometry, Cell Culture, Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry, Cell Proliferation Assay, Migration Assay",,Not Applicable,PXD032403,Open Access,Pan-cancer,,,37169593

Although recent large-scale transcriptomic studies have demonstrated that heterogeneous gene expressions play an essential role in determining molecular phenotypes of PDA, biological cues for and consequences of distinct transcriptional programs remain unclear. Methods: We developed an experimental model that enforces the transition of PDA cells toward a basal-like subtype. We combined epigenome and transcriptome analyses with extensive in vitro and in vivo evaluations of tumorigenicity to demonstrate the validity of basal-like subtype differentiation in association with endothelial-like enhancer landscapes via TEA domain transcription factor 2 (TEAD2). Finally, we used loss-of-function experiments to investigate the importance of TEAD2 in regulating reprogrammed enhancer landscape and metastasis in basal-like PDA cells. Results: Aggressive characteristics of the basal-like subtype are faithfully recapitulated in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating the physiological relevance of our model. Further, we showed that basal-like subtype PDA cells acquire a TEAD2-dependent proangiogenic enhancer landscape. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibitions of TEAD2 in basal-like subtype PDA cells impair their proangiogenic phenotypes in vitro and cancer progression in vivo. Last, we identify CD109 as a critical TEAD2 downstream mediator that maintains constitutively activated JAK-STAT signaling in basal-like PDA cells and tumors. Conclusions: Our findings implicate a TEAD2-CD109-JAK/STAT axis in the basal-like differentiated pancreatic cancer cells and as a potential therapeutic vulnerability.","Cell Culture, Plasmid Construction, RT-PCR, ChIP-Seq, ATAC-Seq, RNA Sequencing",,Pancreas,GSE202534,Open Access,Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma,,,36907523

However, the mechanisms of tumor induction of these enzymes are unclear. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed correlations between NOS2 and COX2 expression and Th1 cytokines. Herein, single-cell RNAseq analysis of TNBC cells shows potent NOS2 and COX2 induction by IFNγ combined with IL1β or TNFα. Given that IFNγ is secreted by cytolytic lymphocytes, which improve clinical outcomes, this role of IFNγ presents a dichotomy. To explore this conundrum, tumor NOS2, COX2, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were spatially analyzed in aggressive ER-, TNBC, and HER2 + breast tumors. High expression and clustering of NOS2-expressing tumor cells occurred at the tumor/stroma interface in the presence of stroma-restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. High expression and clustering of COX2-expressing tumor cells extended into immune desert regions in the tumor core where CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell penetration was limited or absent. Moreover, high NOS2-expressing tumor cells were proximal to areas with increased satellitosis, suggestive of cell clusters with a higher metastatic potential.

Deregulation of CSN5 could affect diverse cellular functions that contribute to tumor development, but there has been no comprehensive study of its function in prostate cancer. The clinical significance of CSN5 amplification/overexpression was evaluated in 16 prostate cancer clinical cohorts. Its oncogenic activity was assessed by genetic and pharmacologic perturbations of CSN5 activity in prostate cancer cell lines. The molecular mechanisms of CSN5 function were assessed, as was the efficacy of the CSN5 inhibitor CSN5i-3 in vitro and in vivo. Finally, the transcription cofactor activity of CSN5 in prostate cancer cells was determined. The prognostic significance of CSN5 amplification and overexpression in prostate cancer was independent of MYC amplification. Inhibition of CSN5 inhibited its oncogenic function by targeting AR signaling, DNA repair, multiple oncogenic pathways, and spliceosome regulation. Furthermore, inhibition of CSN5 repressed metabolic pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis in AR-negative prostate cancer cells. Targeting CSN5 with CSN5i-3 showed potent antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, CSN5i-3 synergizes with PARP inhibitors to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth. CSN5 functions as a transcription cofactor to cooperate with multiple transcription factors in prostate cancer.

The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors has resulted in impressive and durable clinical responses in the treatment of various cancers. Additionally, immunotherapy utilizing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cells has produced robust responses in blood cancers, and T cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cells are showing promising results in the treatment of solid cancers. Despite these noteworthy advancements in cancer immunotherapy, numerous challenges remain. Some patient populations are unresponsive to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, and CAR T cell therapy has yet to show efficacy against solid cancers. In this review, we first discuss the significant role that T cells play in the body's defense against cancer. We then delve into the mechanisms behind the current challenges facing immunotherapy, starting with T cell exhaustion due to immune checkpoint upregulation and changes in the transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes of dysfunctional T cells. We then discuss cancer-cell-intrinsic characteristics, including molecular alterations in cancer cells and the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment (TME), which collectively facilitate tumor cell proliferation, survival, metastasis, and immune evasion. Finally, we examine recent advancements in cancer immunotherapy, with a specific emphasis on T-cell-based treatments.",Immunotherapy,,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,Pan-cancer,,,37239368

Because of substantial interobserver variability in the application of the BI-RADS lexicon, the decision to biopsy varies greatly and results in overdiagnosis and excessive biopsies. The false-positive rate from mammograms is estimated to be 7% to approximately 10% overall, but within the BI-RADS 4 category, it is greater than 70%. Therefore, we developed the Breast Cancer Risk Calculator (BRISK) to target a well-characterized and specific patient subgroup (BI-RADS 4) rather than a broad heterogeneous group in assessing breast cancer risk. Methods: BRISK provides a novel precise risk assessment model to reduce overdiagnosis and unnecessary biopsies. It was developed by applying natural language processing and deep learning methods on 5,147 patient records archived in the Houston Methodist systemwide data warehouse from 2006 to May 2015, including imaging and pathology reports, mammographic images, and patient demographics. Key characteristics for BI-RADS 4 patients were collected and computed to output an index measure for biopsy recommendation that is clinically relevant and informative and improves upon the traditional BI-RADS 4 scores. Results: For the validation set, we assessed data from 1,247 BI-RADS 4 patients, including mammographic images and medical reports. The BRISK model sensitivity to predict malignancy was 100%, whereas the specificity was 74%. The total accuracy of our implemented model in BRISK was 81%. Overall area under the curve was 0.93. Conclusion: BRISK for abnormal mammogram uses integrative artificial intelligence technology and has demonstrated high sensitivity in the prediction of malignancy. Prospective evaluation is under way and can lead to improvement in patient-physician engagement in making informed decisions with regard to biopsy.","Computational Tool, Computational Modeling",,Breast,Not Applicable,Open Access,Breast Neoplasm,,https://bcrisktool.cancer.gov/,31141423

However, the interplay between the mechanical and signaling processes that drive dynamic behavior in vascular endothelial cells is not well understood. In this study, we propose a chemo-mechanical model to investigate the regulation of endothelial junctions as dependent on the feedback between actomyosin contractility, VE-cadherin bond turnover, and actin polymerization, which mediate the forces exerted on the cell-cell interface. Simulations reveal that active cell tension can stabilize cadherin bonds, but excessive RhoA signaling can drive bond dissociation and junction failure. While actin polymerization aids gap closure, high levels of Rac1 can induce junction weakening. Combining the modeling framework with experiments, our model predicts the influence of pharmacological treatments on the junction state and identifies that a critical balance between RhoA and Rac1 expression is required to maintain junction stability. Our proposed framework can help guide the development of therapeutics that target the Rho family of GTPases and downstream active mechanical processes.","Electron Microscopy, Computational Modeling",,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,Pan-cancer,,,36402771

Parental and JQ1-resistant SUM149 and SUM159 exhibited a stem cell-like and embryonic diapause (SCLED) cell state as well as a transitional cell state between the SCLED state that is present in both treatment naïve and JQ1 treated cells, and a number of JQ1 resistant cell states. A transitional cell state transcriptional signature but not a SCLED state transcriptional signature predicted worsened outcomes in basal-like breast cancer patients suggesting that transit from the SCLED state to drug-resistant states contributes to patient outcomes.

Whereas ctDNA positivity associates with reduced distant recurrence-free survival in both subtypes. Conversely, ctDNA negativity after NAC correlates with improved outcomes, even in patients with extensive residual cancer. Pretreatment tumor mRNA profiling reveals associations between ctDNA shedding and cell cycle and immune-associated signaling. On the basis of these findings, the I-SPY2 trial will prospectively test ctDNA for utility in redirecting therapy to improve response and prognosis.",Cell-free Circulating Tumor DNA Assay,,Breast,GSE194040,Open Access,Breast Carcinoma,,,37146605

We apply this approach to analyze live-cell images of MCF10A mammary epithelial cells after treatment with a panel of microenvironmental perturbagens that strongly modulate cell motility, morphology, and cell cycle behavior. Our morphodynamical trajectory embedding analysis constructs a shared cell state landscape revealing ligand-specific regulation of cell state transitions and enables quantitative and descriptive models of single-cell trajectories. Additionally, we show that incorporation of trajectories into single-cell morphological analysis enables (i) systematic characterization of cell state trajectories, (ii) better separation of phenotypes, and (iii) more descriptive models of ligand-induced differences as compared to snapshot-based analysis. This morphodynamical trajectory embedding is broadly applicable to the quantitative analysis of cell responses via live-cell imaging across many biological and biomedical applications.","Mathematical Modeling, Imaging",,Not Applicable,,Open Access,Pan-cancer,,,37142678

However, the mechanisms of tumor induction of these enzymes are unclear. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed correlations between NOS2 and COX2 expression and Th1 cytokines. Herein, single-cell RNAseq analysis of TNBC cells shows potent NOS2 and COX2 induction by IFNγ combined with IL1β or TNFα. Given that IFNγ is secreted by cytolytic lymphocytes, which improve clinical outcomes, this role of IFNγ presents a dichotomy. To explore this conundrum, tumor NOS2, COX2, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were spatially analyzed in aggressive ER-, TNBC, and HER2 + breast tumors. High expression and clustering of NOS2-expressing tumor cells occurred at the tumor/stroma interface in the presence of stroma-restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. High expression and clustering of COX2-expressing tumor cells extended into immune desert regions in the tumor core where CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell penetration was limited or absent. Moreover, high NOS2-expressing tumor cells were proximal to areas with increased satellitosis, suggestive of cell clusters with a higher metastatic potential. Further in vitro experiments revealed that IFNγ + IL1β/TNFα increased the elongation and migration of treated tumor cells.

Here, we integrated transcriptomic data and digital pathology images to study the prognostic implications, spatial locations, and constitution of immune rich areas (immune hotspots) in a cohort of 935 patients with lung cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas. A high intratumoral immune hotspot score, which measures the proportion of immune hotspots interfacing with tumor islands, was correlated with poor overall survival in lung squamous cell carcinoma but not in lung adenocarcinoma. Lung squamous cell carcinomas with high intratumoral immune hotspot scores were characterized by consistent upregulation of B-cell signatures. Spatial statistical analyses conducted on serial multiplex IHC slides further revealed that only 4.87% of peritumoral immune hotspots and 0.26% of intratumoral immune hotspots were tertiary lymphoid structures. Significantly lower densities of CD20+CXCR5+ and CD79b+ B cells and less diverse immune cell interactions were found in intratumoral immune hotspots compared with peritumoral immune hotspots. Furthermore, there was a negative correlation between the percentages of CD8+ T cells and T regulatory cells in intratumoral but not in peritumoral immune hotspots, with tertiary lymphoid structures excluded. These findings suggest that the intratumoral immune hotspots reflect an immunosuppressive niche compared with peritumoral immune hotspots, independent of the distribution of tertiary lymphoid structures. A balance toward increased intratumoral immune hotspots is indicative of a compromised antitumor immune response and poor outcome in lung squamous cell carcinoma. Significance: Intratumoral immune hotspots beyond tertiary lymphoid structures reflect an immunosuppressive microenvironment, different from peritumoral immune hotspots, warranting further study in the context of immunotherapies.","Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method, Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis, Survival Analysis, Multiplexed Immunohistochemistry, Deep Learning ",,Lung,,Open Access,"Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Lung Non-Small Cell Carcinoma",,,36853169

However, using these models to perform a multitude of experiments, including drug screening, is prohibitive both in terms of cost and time. Three-dimensional (3D) culture systems are widely viewed as platforms in which cancer cells retain their biological integrity through biochemical interactions, morphology, and architecture. Our team has extensive experience culturing PDX cells in vitro using 3D matrices composed of hyaluronic acid (HA). In order to separate mouse fibroblast stromal cells associated with PDXs, we use rotation culture, where stromal cells adhere to the surface of tissue culture-treated plates while dissociated PDX tumor cells float and self-associate into multicellular clusters. Also floating in the supernatant are single, often dead cells, which present a challenge in collecting viable PDX clusters for downstream encapsulation into hydrogels for 3D cell culture. In order to separate these single cells from live cell clusters, we have employed density step gradient centrifugation. The protocol described here allows for the depletion of non-viable single cells from the healthy population of cell clusters that will be used for further in vitro experimentation. In our studies, we incorporate the 3D cultures in microfluidic plates which allow for media perfusion during culture. After assessing the resultant cultures using a fluorescent image-based viability assay of purified versus non-purified cells, our results show that this additional separation step substantially reduced the number of non-viable cells from our cultures.","Patient Derived Xenograft, 3D Bioprinting, 3D Cell Culture",,Not Applicable,,Open Access,Pan-cancer,,,33346184

In many cancers, these mechanisms have been observed to induce dynamic switching between two or more cell states, which commonly show differential responses to drug treatments. To understand how these cancers evolve over time, and how they respond to treatment, we need to understand the state-dependent rates of cell proliferation and phenotypic switching. In this work, we propose a rigorous statistical framework for estimating these parameters, using data from commonly performed cell line experiments, where phenotypes are sorted and expanded in culture. The framework explicitly models the stochastic dynamics of cell division, cell death and phenotypic switching, and it provides likelihood-based confidence intervals for the model parameters. The input data can be either the fraction of cells or the number of cells in each state at one or more time points. Through a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we show that when cell fraction data is used, the rates of switching may be the only parameters that can be estimated accurately. On the other hand, using cell number data enables accurate estimation of the net division rate for each phenotype, and it can even enable estimation of the state-dependent rates of cell division and cell death. We conclude by applying our framework to a publicly available dataset.","Mathematical Modeling, Computational Modeling ",,Not Applicable,,Restricted Access,Pan-cancer,,,37087049

However, the chemically complex and spatially heterogeneous composition of tissue specimens and the inherently weak interaction of infrared light with biomolecules limit the analytical performance of infrared absorption spectroscopy. Here, an advanced mid-infrared spectrochemical tissue imaging modality is introduced using metasurfaces that support strong surface-localized electromagnetic fields to capture quantitative molecular maps of large-area murine brain tissue sections. The approach leverages polarization-multiplexed multi-resonance plasmonic metasurfaces to simultaneously detect various functional biomolecules. The surface-enhanced mid-infrared spectral imaging method eliminates the non-specific effects of bulk tissue morphology on quantitative spectral analysis and improves chemical selectivity. This study shows that metasurface enhancement increases the retrieval of amide I and II bands associated with protein secondary structures. Moreover, it is demonstrated that plasmonic metasurfaces enhance the chemical contrast in infrared images and enable detection of ultrathin tissue regions that are not otherwise visible to conventional mid-infrared spectral imaging.
