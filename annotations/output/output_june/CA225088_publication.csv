We used multiplexed imaging, quantitative spatial analysis, and machine learning to create high-definition maps of lung tumors from a Kras/Trp53-mutant mouse model and human resections.

Many of these treatments cause cardiotoxicity with limited cure. We aim to clarify molecular mechanisms of TKI-induced cardiotoxicity so as to find potential targets for treating the adverse cardiac complications. Methods: Eight TKIs with different levels of cardiotoxicity reported (Read more on Pubmed),"Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-derived Cardiomyocytes Culture, RNA Sequencing, ",Pan-cancer,Heart,"PRJNA472575, GSE114686",Open Access,37069550
