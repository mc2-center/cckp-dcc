We used multiplexed imaging, quantitative spatial analysis, and machine learning to create high-definition maps of lung tumors from a Kras/Trp53-mutant mouse model and human resections. Networks of interacting lymphocytes (""lymphonets"") emerged as a distinctive feature of the anti-cancer immune response. Lymphonets nucleated from small T cell clusters and incorporated B cells with increasing size. CXCR3-mediated trafficking modulated lymphonet size and number, but T cell antigen expression directed intratumoral localization. Lymphonets preferentially harbored TCF1<sup>+</sup> PD-1<sup>+</sup> progenitor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells involved in responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Upon treatment of mice with ICB or an antigen-targeted vaccine, lymphonets retained progenitor and gained cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell populations, likely via progenitor differentiation.

Many of these treatments cause cardiotoxicity with limited cure. We aim to clarify molecular mechanisms of TKI-induced cardiotoxicity so as to find potential targets for treating the adverse cardiac complications. Methods: Eight TKIs with different levels of cardiotoxicity reported are selected. Phenotypic and transcriptomic responses of human cardiomyocytes to TKIs at varying doses and times are profiled and analyzed. Stress responses and signaling pathways that modulate cardiotoxicity induced by three TKIs are validated in cardiomyocytes and rat hearts. Results: Toxicity rank of the eight TKIs determined by measuring their effects on cell viability, contractility, and respiration is largely consistent with that derived from database or literature, indicating that human cardiomyocytes are a good cellular model for studying cardiotoxicity. When transcriptomes are measured for selected TKI treatments with different levels of toxicity in human cardiomyocytes, the data are classified into 7 clusters with mainly single-drug clusters. Drug-specific effects on the transcriptome dominate over dose-, time- or toxicity-dependent effects. Two clusters with three TKIs (afatinib, ponatinib, and sorafenib) have the top enriched pathway as the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). All three TKIs induce ERS in rat primary cardiomyocytes and ponatinib activates the IRE1α-XBP1s axis downstream of ERS in the hearts of rats underwent a 7-day course of drug treatment. To look for potential triggers of ERS, we find that the three TKIs induce transient reactive oxygen species followed by lipid peroxidation. Inhibiting either PERK or IRE1α downstream of ERS blocks TKI-induced cardiac damages, represented by the induction of cardiac fetal and pro-inflammatory genes without causing more cell death. Conclusions: Our data contain rich information about phenotypic and transcriptional responses of human cardiomyocytes to eight TKIs, uncovering potential molecular mechanisms in modulating cardiotoxicity. ER stress is activated by multiple TKIs and leads to cardiotoxicity through promoting expression of pro-inflammatory factors and cardiac fetal genes. ER stress-induced inflammation is a promising therapeutic target to mitigate ponatinib- and sorafenib-induced cardiotoxicity.","Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-derived Cardiomyocytes Culture, RNA Sequencing, ",Pan-cancer,Heart,"PRJNA472575, GSE114686",Open Access,37069550,7957866d-a29d-43f7-9364-1b280bcac437,syn52564814
