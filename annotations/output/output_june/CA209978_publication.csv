The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily that is activated by diverse proinflammatory ligands present in the tumor microenvironment. Activation of RAGE by its ligands stimulates multiple signaling pathways that are important in tumor growth and invasion. However, treatment strategies that only target the interaction of RAGE with its ligands are ineffective as cancer therapies due to the abundance and diversity of exogenous RAGE ligands in gliomas. Methods: As an alternative approach to RAGE ligand inhibition, we evaluated the genetic ablation of RAGE on the tumorigenicity of 2 syngeneic murine glioma models. RAGE expression was inhibited in the GL261 and K-Luc gliomas by shRNA and CRSPR/Cas9 techniques prior to intracranial implantation. Tumor growth, invasion, and inflammatory responses were examined by histology, survival, Nanostring, and flow cytometry. Results: Intracellular RAGE ablation abrogated glioma growth and invasion by suppressing AKT and ERK1/2 activities and by downregulating MMP9 expression. Interestingly, RAGE inhibition in both glioma models enhanced tumor inflammatory responses by downregulating the expression of galectin-3 and potentiated immunotherapy responses to immune checkpoint blockade. Conclusions: We demonstrated that intracellular RAGE ablation suppresses multiple cellular pathways that are important in glioma progression, invasion, and immune escape. These findings strongly support the development of RAGE ablation as a treatment strategy for malignant gliomas.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,36394567,fd2d4946-36fa-4ed1-ba26-24825189203d,syn52500283
