In particular, complex biophysical mechanisms enable a tumor to remodel the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), allowing cells to invade alone or collectively. Tumor spheroids cultured in collagen represent a simplified, reproducible 3D model system, which is sufficie(Read more on Pubmed)",Computational Modeling,Pan-cancer ,Breast,,Open Access,36996248

We have hypothesized that the increased stiffness directly contributes to the dysregulation of the epithelial cell homeostasis in IBD. Here, we aim to determine the impact of tissue stiffening on the fate and function of the intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Methods: We developed a long-term culture sy(Read more on Pubmed)",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,36871599
