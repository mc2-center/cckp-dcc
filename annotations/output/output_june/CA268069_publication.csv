We present here ""Rupture And Deliver"" Tension Gauge Tethers (RAD-TGTs) in which flow cytometry is used to record the mechanical history of thousands of cells exerting forces on their surroundings via their propensity to rupture immobilized DNA duplex tension probes. We demonstrate that RAD-TGTs recapitulate prior DNA tension probe studies while also yielding a gain of fluorescence in the force-generating cell that is detectable by flow cytometry. Furthermore, the rupture propensity is altered following disruption of the cytoskeleton using drugs or CRISPR-knockout of mechanosensing proteins. Importantly, RAD-TGTs can differentiate distinct mechanotypes among mixed populations of cells. We also establish oligo rupture and delivery can be measured via DNA sequencing. RAD-TGTs provide a facile and powerful assay to enable high-throughput mechanotype profiling, which could find various applications, for example, in combination with CRISPR screens and -omics analysis.","Cell Culture, Flow Cytometry",Glioma,Not Applicable,PRJNA956930,Open Access,37117218,1d8ad933-5244-4e43-95b4-3154d0f09bbd,syn52566262

However, the chemically complex and spatially heterogeneous composition of tissue specimens and the inherently weak interaction of infrared light with biomolecules limit the analytical performance of infrared absorption spectroscopy. Here, an advanced mid-infrared spectrochemical tissue imaging modality is introduced using metasurfaces that support strong surface-localized electromagnetic fields to capture quantitative molecular maps of large-area murine brain tissue sections. The approach leverages polarization-multiplexed multi-resonance plasmonic metasurfaces to simultaneously detect various functional biomolecules. The surface-enhanced mid-infrared spectral imaging method eliminates the non-specific effects of bulk tissue morphology on quantitative spectral analysis and improves chemical selectivity. This study shows that metasurface enhancement increases the retrieval of amide I and II bands associated with protein secondary structures. Moreover, it is demonstrated that plasmonic metasurfaces enhance the chemical contrast in infrared images and enable detection of ultrathin tissue regions that are not otherwise visible to conventional mid-infrared spectral imaging. While this work uses murine brain tissue sections, theÂ chemical imaging method is well-suited for other tissue types, which broadens its potential impact for translational research and clinical histopathology.","Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, Microscopy
