However, using these models to perform a multitude of experiments, including drug screening, is prohibitive both in terms of cost and time. Three-dimensional (3D) culture systems are widely viewed as platforms in which cancer cells retain their biological integrity through biochemical interactions, morphology, and architecture. Our team has extensive experience culturing PDX cells in vitro using 3D matrices composed of hyaluronic acid (HA). In order to separate mouse fibroblast stromal cells associated with PDXs, we use rotation culture, where stromal cells adhere to the surface of tissue culture-treated plates while dissociated PDX tumor cells float and self-associate into multicellular clusters. Also floating in the supernatant are single, often dead cells, which present a challenge in collecting viable PDX clusters for downstream encapsulation into hydrogels for 3D cell culture. In order to separate these single cells from live cell clusters, we have employed density step gradient centrifugation. The protocol described here allows for the depletion of non-viable single cells from the healthy population of cell clusters that will be used for further in vitro experimentation. In our studies, we incorporate the 3D cultures in microfluidic plates which allow for media perfusion during culture. After assessing the resultant cultures using a fluorescent image-based viability assay of purified versus non-purified cells, our results show that this additional separation step substantially reduced the number of non-viable cells from our cultures.","Patient Derived Xenograft, 3D Bioprinting, 3D Cell Culture",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,,Open Access,33346184,191ec19c-40fa-4dca-a8af-ce3770e51436,syn52564788

CSN5, a putative androgen receptor (AR) partner that is located on chromosome 8q, is the key subunit of the COP9 signalosome, which deactivates ubiquitin ligases. Deregulation of CSN5 could affect diverse cellular functions that contribute to tumor development, but there has been no comprehensive study of its function in prostate cancer. The clinical significance of CSN5 amplification/overexpression was evaluated in 16 prostate cancer clinical cohorts. Its oncogenic activity was assessed by genetic and pharmacologic perturbations of CSN5 activity in prostate cancer cell lines. The molecular mechanisms of CSN5 function were assessed, as was the efficacy of the CSN5 inhibitor CSN5i-3 in vitro and in vivo. Finally, the transcription cofactor activity of CSN5 in prostate cancer cells was determined. The prognostic significance of CSN5 amplification and overexpression in prostate cancer was independent of MYC amplification. Inhibition of CSN5 inhibited its oncogenic function by targeting AR signaling, DNA repair, multiple oncogenic pathways, and spliceosome regulation. Furthermore, inhibition of CSN5 repressed metabolic pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis in AR-negative prostate cancer cells. Targeting CSN5 with CSN5i-3 showed potent antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, CSN5i-3 synergizes with PARP inhibitors to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth. CSN5 functions as a transcription cofactor to cooperate with multiple transcription factors in prostate cancer. Inhibiting CSN5 strongly attenuates prostate cancer progression and could enhance PARP inhibition efficacy in the treatment of prostate cancer.","Cell Culture, Gene Silencing, CUT&Tag-Sequencing, Antitumor Drug Screening Assay, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis",Prostate Neoplasm,Not Applicable,PRJNA725705,Open Access,34802033,ee200f46-3b90-4c1e-8ac0-836812f4cbf7,syn52564788

We generated a genetically engineered mouse with prostate-specific expression of the <i>ETS</i> factor, ETV4, at lower and higher protein dosage through mutation of its degron. Lower-level expression of ETV4 caused mild luminal cell expansion without histologic abnormalities, and higher-level expression of stabilized ETV4 caused prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN) with 100% penetrance within 1 week. Tumor progression was limited by p53-mediated senescence and <i>Trp53</i> deletion cooperated with stabilized ETV4. The neoplastic cells expressed differentiation markers such as Nkx3.1 recapitulating luminal gene expression features of untreated human prostate cancer. Single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing showed that stabilized ETV4 induced a previously unidentified luminal-derived expression cluster with signatures of cell cycle, senescence, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. These data suggest that <i>ETS</i> overexpression alone, at sufficient dosage, can initiate prostate neoplasia.","DNA Sequencing, Immunofluorescent Staining Method, ATAC-Seq, ChIP-Seq, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis",Prostate Neoplasm ,Not Applicable,,Open Access,37018402,47f6a196-28f7-4ac1-a5d0-a23302fff31f,syn52564788
