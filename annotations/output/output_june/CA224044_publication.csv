However, using these models to perform a multitude of experiments, including drug screening, is prohibitive both in terms of cos(Read more on Pubmed)","Patient Derived Xenograft, 3D Bioprinting, 3D Cell Culture",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,,Open Access,33346184

CSN5, a putative androgen receptor (AR) partner that is located on chromosome 8q, is the key subunit of the COP9 signalosome, which deactivates ubiquitin ligases. Deregulation of CSN5 could affect diverse cellular functions that contribute to tumor devel(Read more on Pubmed)","Cell Culture, Gene Silencing, CUT&Tag-Sequencing, Antitumor Drug Screening Assay, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)",Prostate Cancer ,Not Applicable,PRJNA725705,Open Access,34802033

We generated a genetically engineered mouse with prostate-specific expression of the <i>ETS</i> factor, ETV4, at lower and higher protein dosage through mutation of its degron. Lower-level expression of ETV4 caused mild lum(Read more on Pubmed)","DNA Sequencing, Immunofluorescent Staining Method, ATAC-seq, ChIP-Seq, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)",Prostate Cancer ,Not Applicable,,Open Access,37018402
