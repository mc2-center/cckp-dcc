Using multicolor lineage tracing in genetically engineered mouse models and single-cell transcriptomics, we show that slowly progressing tumors contain a multiclonal landscape of relatively homogeneous subpopulations within a well-organized tumor microenvironment. In more advanced and aggressive tumors, however, the multiclonal landscape develops into competing dominant and minor clones accompanied by a disordered microenvironment. We demonstrate that this dominant/minor landscape is associated with differential immunoediting, in which minor clones are marked by an increased expression of IFNγ-response genes and the T cell-activating chemokines Cxcl9 and Cxcl11. Furthermore, immunomodulation of the IFNγ pathway can rescue minor clones from elimination. Notably, the immune-specific gene signature of minor clones exhibits a prognostic value for biochemical recurrence-free survival in human prostate cancer. These findings suggest new immunotherapy approaches for modulating clonal fitness and tumor progression in prostate cancer.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,37148881,e1765679-520d-4a7f-9dc4-5359370320e5,syn52566254
