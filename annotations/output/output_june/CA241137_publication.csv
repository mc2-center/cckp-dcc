In many cancers, these mechanisms have been observed to induce dynamic switching between two or more cell states, which commonly show differential responses to drug treatments. To understand how these cancers evolve over time, and how they respond to treatment, we need to unde(Read more on Pubmed)","Mathematical Modeling, Computational Modeling ",Pan-cancer,Not-applicable,,Restricted Access,37087049
