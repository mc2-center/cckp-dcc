To investigate subtype-specific differences in the clinical significance and biology of ctDNA shedding, we perform serial personalized ctDNA analysis in hormone receptor (HR)-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients receiving(Read more on Pubmed)",Cell-free Circulating Tumor DNA Assay,Breast Carcinoma,Breast,GSE194040,Open Access,37146605

The coordinated regulation of these proteomic changes maintains genome stability. Traditionally, regulators and mediators of DDR have been investigated individually. However, recent advances in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics enable us to globally quantify changes in protein abund(Read more on Pubmed)",Proteomics Assay,Pan-cancer,Not-applicable,,Open Access,37213254
