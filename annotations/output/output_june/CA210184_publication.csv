The resulting bioenergetic stress leads to signaling and metabolic adaptation responses in tumor cells, secures survival, and adjusts migration activity. The kinetic responses of cancer cells to energy deficit were recently identified, including a switch of invasive c(Read more on Pubmed)",3D Cell Culture,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,,Open Access,36328835
