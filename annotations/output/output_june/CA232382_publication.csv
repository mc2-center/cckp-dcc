These biological phenomena are particularly suited to be captured at the cell-scale resolution possible only within agent-based or individual-based mathematical models. These modeling approaches complement experimental work (in vitro and in vivo systems) through parameterization and data extrapolation but also feed forward to drive new experiments that test model-generated predictions.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,36404257,34d32042-97f7-44d8-9085-c7b32a6d0ecd,syn52565154
