Histologic observations suggest that during metastatic spread of carcinomas, these cues influence transformed epithelial cells, prompting a diversity of migration modes spanning single cell and multicellular phenotypes. Purported consequences of these variations in tumor escape strategies include differential metastatic capability and therapy resistance. Therefore, understanding how cues from the peritumoral stromal microenvironment regulate migration mode has both prognostic and therapeutic value. Here, we utilize a synthetic stromal mimetic in which matrix fiber density and bulk hydrogel mechanics can be orthogonally tuned to investigate the contribution of these two key matrix attributes on MCF10A migration mode phenotypes, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and invasive potential. We develop an automated computational image analysis framework to extract migratory phenotypes from fluorescent images and determine 3D migration metrics relevant to metastatic spread. Using this analysis, we find that matrix fiber density and bulk hydrogel mechanics distinctly contribute to a variety of MCF10A migration modes including amoeboid, single mesenchymal, clusters, and strands. We identify combinations of physical and soluble cues that induce a variety of migration modes originating from the same MCF10A spheroid and use these settings to examine a functional consequence of migration mode -resistance to apoptosis. We find that cells migrating as strands are more resistant to staurosporine-induced apoptosis than either disconnected clusters or individual invading cells. Improved models of the peritumoral stromal microenvironment and understanding of the relationships between matrix attributes and cell migration mode can aid ongoing efforts to identify effective cancer therapeutics that address cell plasticity-based therapy resistances. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Stromal extracellular matrix structure dictates both cell homeostasis and activation towards migratory phenotypes. However decoupling the effects of myriad biophysical cues has been difficult to achieve. Here, we encapsulate electrospun fiber segments within an amorphous hydrogel to create a fiber-reinforced hydrogel composite in which fiber density and hydrogel stiffness can be orthogonally tuned. Quantification of 3D cell migration reveal these two parameters uniquely contribute to a diversity of migration phenotypes spanning amoeboid, single mesenchymal, multicellular cluster, and collective strand. By tuning biophysical and biochemical cues to elicit heterogeneous migration phenotypes, we find that collective strands best resist apoptosis. This work establishes a composite approach to modulate fibrous topography and bulk hydrogel mechanics and identified biomaterial parameters to direct distinct 3D cell migration phenotypes.","Xenograft, Migration Assay, Hydrogels, Computational Modeling",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,,Open Access,36179980,ef7ae2bb-8f26-4381-93e6-196204d93b18,syn52500278

Material manipulation in an array of 192 hanging drops induces cells to self-assemble into inside-out organoids where an adipose tissue core is enveloped by a cell-produced basement membrane, indicated by laminin V staining and then a continuous layer of mammary epithelial cells. This inverted tissue structure enables investigation of multiple mammary cancer subtypes, with a significantly higher extent of invasion by triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells compared to MCF7 cells. By seeding cancer cells into co-culture around pre-formed organoids with encapsulated preadipocytes/adipocytes, invasion through the epithelium, then into the adipose core is observable through acquisition of confocal image stacks of whole mount specimens. Furthermore, in regions of the connective tissue core where invasion occurs, there is an accumulation of collagen in the microenvironment. Suggesting that this collagen may be conducive to increased invasiveness, the anti-fibrotic drug pirfenidone shows efficacy in this model by slowing invasion. Comparison of adipose tissue derived from three different donors shows method consistency as well as the potential to evaluate donor cell-based biological variability. Insight box Geometrically inverted mammary organoids encapsulating primary preadipocytes/adipocytes (P/As) are bioengineered using a minimal amount of Matrigel scaffolding. Use of this eversion-free method is key to production of adipose mammary organoids (AMOs) where not only the epithelial polarity but also the entire self-organizing arrangement, including adipose position, is inside-out. While an epithelial-only structure can analyze cancer cell invasion, P/As are required for invasion-associated collagen deposition and efficacy of pirfenidone to counteract collagen deposition and associated invasion. The methods described strike a balance between repeatability and preservation of biological variability: AMOs form consistently across multiple adipose cell donors while revealing cancer cell invasion differences.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,37015816,5d325e80-013e-4743-971f-bc9cba0e3b0b,syn52500278
