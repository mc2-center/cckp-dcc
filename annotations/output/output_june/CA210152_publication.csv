Histologic observations suggest that during metastatic spread of carcinomas, these cues influence transformed epithelial cells, prompting a diversity of migration modes spanning single cell and multicellular phenotypes. Purported consequences of these variations in tumor escape strategie(Read more on Pubmed)","Xenograft, Migration Assay, Hydrogels, Computational Modeling",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,,Open Access,36179980

Material manipulation in an array of 192 hanging drops induces cells to self-assemble into inside-out organoids where an adipose tissue core is enveloped by a cell-produced basement membrane, indicated by laminin V staining and then a continuous layer of mamm(Read more on Pubmed)",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,37015816
