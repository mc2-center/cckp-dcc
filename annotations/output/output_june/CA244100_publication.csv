Mathematical modelling with differential equations is a standard approach to study and predict treatment outcomes for population-level and patient-specific responses. Here, we use patient data of radiation-treated tumours to discuss the benefi(Read more on Pubmed)",Mathematical Modeling,Pan-cancer,Not-applicable,,Open Access,37186175
