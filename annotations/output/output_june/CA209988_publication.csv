Here, we exploit the concept of ""trajectory embedding"" to analyze cellular behavior using morphological feature trajectory histories-that is, multiple time points simultaneously, rather than the more common practice of (Read more on Pubmed)","Mathematical Modeling, Imaging",Pan-cancer,Not-applicable,,Open Access,37142678
