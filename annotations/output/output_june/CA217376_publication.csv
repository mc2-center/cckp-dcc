Here, we integrated transcriptomic data and digital pathology images to study the prognostic implications, spatial locations, and constitution of immune rich areas (immune hotspots) in a cohort of 935 patients with lung cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas. A high intratumoral immune hotspot score, which measures the proportion of immune hotspots interfacing with tumor islands, was correlated with poor overall survival in lung squamous cell carcinoma but not in lung adenocarcinoma. Lung squamous cell carcinomas with high intratumoral immune hotspot scores were characterized by consistent upregulation of B-cell signatures. Spatial statistical analyses conducted on serial multiplex IHC slides further revealed that only 4.87% of peritumoral immune hotspots and 0.26% of intratumoral immune hotspots were tertiary lymphoid structures. Significantly lower densities of CD20+CXCR5+ and CD79b+ B cells and less diverse immune cell interactions were found in intratumoral immune hotspots compared with peritumoral immune hotspots. Furthermore, there was a negative correlation between the percentages of CD8+ T cells and T regulatory cells in intratumoral but not in peritumoral immune hotspots, with tertiary lymphoid structures excluded. These findings suggest that the intratumoral immune hotspots reflect an immunosuppressive niche compared with peritumoral immune hotspots, independent of the distribution of tertiary lymphoid structures. A balance toward increased intratumoral immune hotspots is indicative of a compromised antitumor immune response and poor outcome in lung squamous cell carcinoma. Significance: Intratumoral immune hotspots beyond tertiary lymphoid structures reflect an immunosuppressive microenvironment, different from peritumoral immune hotspots, warranting further study in the context of immunotherapies.","Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method, Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis, Survival Analysis, Multiplexed Immunohistochemistry, Deep Learning ","Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Lung Non-Small Cell Carcinoma",Lung,,Open Access,36853169,2a0970ad-962d-4e15-a798-e15dbfd41a6e,syn52543483

Understanding what is consistent and varies across species can provide new insights into cancer initiation and evolution, with significant implications for animal welfare and wildlife conservation. We build a pan-species cancer digital pathology atlas (panspecies.ai) and conduct a pan-species study of computational comparative pathology using a supervised convolutional neural network algorithm trained on human samples. The artificial intelligence algorithm achieves high accuracy in measuring immune response through single-cell classification for two transmissible cancers (canine transmissible venereal tumour, 0.94; Tasmanian devil facial tumour disease, 0.88). In 18 other vertebrate species (mammalia = 11, reptilia = 4, aves = 2, and amphibia = 1), accuracy (range 0.57-0.94) is influenced by cell morphological similarity preserved across different taxonomic groups, tumour sites, and variations in the immune compartment. Furthermore, a spatial immune score based on artificial intelligence and spatial statistics is associated with prognosis in canine melanoma and prostate tumours. A metric, named morphospace overlap, is developed to guide veterinary pathologists towards rational deployment of this technology on new samples. This study provides the foundation and guidelines for transferring artificial intelligence technologies to veterinary pathology based on understanding of morphological conservation, which could vastly accelerate developments in veterinary medicine and comparative oncology.","Computational Modeling, Artificial Intelligence",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,,Open Access,37100774,90cbf922-f20a-46d1-b5a9-50df853c8459,syn52543483
