Here, we integrated transcriptomic data and digital pathology images to study the prognostic implications, spatial locations, and constitution of immune rich areas (immune hotspots) in a cohort of 935 patients with lung cancer from The C(Read more on Pubmed)","Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method, Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis, Survival Analysis, Multiplexed Immunohistochemistry, Deep Learning ","Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Lung Non-Small Cell Carcinoma",Lung,,Open Access,36853169

Understanding what is consistent and varies across species can provide new insights into cancer initiation and evolution, with significant implications for animal welfare and wildlife conservation. We build a pan-species cancer digital pathology atlas (panspecies.ai) and conduct a pan-species study of computational comparative pathology using a supervised convolutiona(Read more on Pubmed)","Computational Modeling, Artificial Intelligence",Pan-cancer,Not-applicable,,Open Access,37100774
