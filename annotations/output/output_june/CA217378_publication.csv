The vascularized microtumor (VMT), or ""tumor-on-a-chip,"" is a physiologic preclinical cancer model that incorporates key features of the native human tumor microenvironment within a transparent microfluidic platform, allowing rapid drug screening in vitro. Herein we optimize methods for generating patient-derived VMT (pVMT) using fresh colorectal cancer (CRC) biopsies and surgical resections to test drug sensitivities at the individual patient level. In response to standard chemotherapy and TGF-βR1 inhibition, we observe heterogeneous responses between pVMT derived from 6 patient biopsies, with the pVMT recapitulating tumor growth, histological features, metabolic heterogeneity, and drug responses of actual CRC tumors. Our results suggest that a translational infrastructure providing rapid information from patient-derived tumor cells in the pVMT, as established in this study, will support efforts to improve patient outcomes.","Cell Culture, Viral Transduction, Flow Cytometry, Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy, Microfluidics",Colorectal Adenocarcinoma,Not Applicable,,Open Access,36481562,e9a20d04-d647-43f2-9e79-e21bff62267e,syn52543484

The model consists of an Allen-Cahn equation describing the evolution of the phase field parameter that describes the shape of the vesicle and a Cahn-Hilliard-type equation describing the evolution of the ionic fluid. We establish conditions for vesicle growth or shrinkage via a common tangent construction using free energy curves. During the membrane deformation, the model ensures total mass conservation of the ionic fluid, and we weakly enforce a surface area constraint of the vesicle. We develop a stable numerical scheme and an efficient nonlinear multigrid solver to evolve the phase and concentration fields, and we use this to evolve the fields to near equilibrium for 2D vesicles. Convergence tests confirm an [Formula: see text] accuracy for our scheme and near-optimal convergence for our multigrid solver. Numerical results reveal that the diffuse interface model captures the main features of cell shape dynamics: for a growing vesicle, there exist circle-like equilibrium shapes if the concentration difference across the membrane and the initial osmotic pressure are large enough; while for a shrinking vesicle, there exists a rich collection of finger-like equilibrium morphologies.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,37219647,bb92ac65-0da3-4a19-a32b-7d50df7b2769,syn52543484
