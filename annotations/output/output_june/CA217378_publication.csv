The vascularized microtumor (VMT), or ""tumor-on-a-chip,"" is a physiologic preclinical cancer model that incorporates key features of the native human tumor microenvironment within a transparent microfluidic p(Read more on Pubmed)","Cell Culture, Viral Transduction, Flow Cytometry, Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy, Microfluidics",Colorectal Adenocarcinoma,Not Applicable,,Open Access,36481562

The model consists of an Allen-Cahn equation describing the evolution of the phase field parameter that describes the shape of the vesicle and a Cahn-Hilliard-type equation describing the evolution of the ionic fluid. We establish conditions for vesicle growth or shri(Read more on Pubmed),Pending Annotation,,,,Restricted Access,37219647
