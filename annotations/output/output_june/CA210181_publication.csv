Most symptoms manifest at an advanced stage of the disease when surgery is no longer appropriate. The dire prognosis of PDAC warrants new strategies to improve the outcomes of patients, and early detection has garnered significant attention. However, early detection of PDAC is most often incidental, emphasizing the importance of developing new early detection screening strategies. Due to the low incidence of the disease in the general population, much of the focus for screening has turned to individuals at high risk of PDAC. This enriches the screening population and balances the risks associated with pancreas interventions. The cancers that are found in these high-risk individuals by MRI and/or EUS screening show favorable 73% 5-year overall survival. Even with the emphasis on screening in enriched high-risk populations, only a minority of incident cancers are detected this way. One strategy to improve early detection outcomes is to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into biomarker discovery and risk models. This expert review summarizes recent publications that have developed AI algorithms for the applications of risk stratification of PDAC using radiomics and electronic health records. Furthermore, this review illustrates the current uses of radiomics and biomarkers in AI for early detection of PDAC. Finally, various challenges and potential solutions are highlighted regarding the use of AI in medicine for early detection purposes.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,37124705,f0da001c-bc38-40dc-9b49-c25e86276b62,syn52500360

The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors has resulted in impressive and durable clinical responses in the treatment of various cancers. Additionally, immunotherapy utilizing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cells has produced robust responses in blood cancers, and T cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cells are showing promising results in the treatment of solid cancers. Despite these noteworthy advancements in cancer immunotherapy, numerous challenges remain. Some patient populations are unresponsive to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, and CAR T cell therapy has yet to show efficacy against solid cancers. In this review, we first discuss the significant role that T cells play in the body's defense against cancer. We then delve into the mechanisms behind the current challenges facing immunotherapy, starting with T cell exhaustion due to immune checkpoint upregulation and changes in the transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes of dysfunctional T cells. We then discuss cancer-cell-intrinsic characteristics, including molecular alterations in cancer cells and the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment (TME), which collectively facilitate tumor cell proliferation, survival, metastasis, and immune evasion. Finally, we examine recent advancements in cancer immunotherapy, with a specific emphasis on T-cell-based treatments.","CRISPR, Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Therapy",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,,Open Access,37239368,bfc3cfa8-a36a-4fed-8b68-5d86f3fb29d3,syn52500360

However, the mechanisms of tumor induction of these enzymes are unclear. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed correlations between NOS2 and COX2 expression and Th1 cytokines. Herein, single-cell RNAseq analysis of TNBC cells shows potent NOS2 and COX2 induction by IFNγ combined with IL1β or TNFα. Given that IFNγ is secreted by cytolytic lymphocytes, which improve clinical outcomes, this role of IFNγ presents a dichotomy. To explore this conundrum, tumor NOS2, COX2, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were spatially analyzed in aggressive ER-, TNBC, and HER2 + breast tumors. High expression and clustering of NOS2-expressing tumor cells occurred at the tumor/stroma interface in the presence of stroma-restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. High expression and clustering of COX2-expressing tumor cells extended into immune desert regions in the tumor core where CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell penetration was limited or absent. Moreover, high NOS2-expressing tumor cells were proximal to areas with increased satellitosis, suggestive of cell clusters with a higher metastatic potential. Further in vitro experiments revealed that IFNγ + IL1β/TNFα increased the elongation and migration of treated tumor cells. This spatial analysis of the tumor microenvironment provides important insight into distinct neighborhoods where stroma-restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells exist proximal to NOS2-expressing tumor niches that could have increased metastatic potential.","Cell Culture, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing, Scratch Assay, Invasion Assay",Breast Carcinoma,Breast,,Open Access,37169743,59b90a08-5be0-43ce-ac3e-cc7eb9917d41,syn52500360
