Most symptoms manifest at an advanced stage of the disease when surgery is no longer appropriate. The dire prognosis of PDAC warrants new strategies to improve the outcomes of patients, and early detection has garnered significant attention. However, early detection o(Read more on Pubmed)",Pending Annotation,,,,Restricted Access,37124705

The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors has resulted in impressive and durable clinical responses in the treatment of various cancers. Additionally, immunotherapy utilizing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cells has produced robust responses in blood cancers, and T cell receptor(Read more on Pubmed)","CRISPR, Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Therapy",Pan-cancer,Not-Applicable,,Open Access,37239368

However, the mechanisms of tumor induction of these enzymes are unclear. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed correlations between NOS2 and COX2 expression and Th1 cytokines. Herein, single-cell RNAseq analysis of TNBC cells shows potent NOS2 and COX2 indu(Read more on Pubmed)","Cell Culture, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing, Scratch Assay, Invasion Assay",Breast Carcinoma,Breast,,Open Access,37169743
