Sialoglycoproteins promote tumor progression and are linked to immune suppression via the sialic acid-Siglec axis. Understanding factors that increase sialoglycoprotein biosynthesis in tumors could identify approaches to improve patient response to immunotherapy. We quantified higher levels of sialoglycoproteins in the fibrotic regions within huma(Read more on Pubmed),"CRISPR, Trichrome Staining Method, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing, Alcian Blue Staining Method, Picrosirius Staining, Immunofluorescent Staining Method",Breast Cancer ,Breast,,Open Access,35392183

A greater abundance of aligned fibrillar collagen is characteristic of invasive and aggressive breast cancers and has been associated with elevated activity of collagen crosslinking enzymes, such as lysyl oxidase (LOX) and lysyl hydroxylases (LH) and the formation of more mature collagen matrix crosslinks.
