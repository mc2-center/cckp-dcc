Sialoglycoproteins promote tumor progression and are linked to immune suppression via the sialic acid-Siglec axis. Understanding factors that increase sialoglycoprotein biosynthesis in tumors could identify approaches to improve patient response to immunotherapy. We quantified higher levels of sialoglycoproteins in the fibrotic regions within human breast tumor tissues. Human breast tumor subtypes, which are more fibrotic, similarly featured increased sialoglycoprotein content. Further analysis revealed the breast cancer cells as the primary cell type synthesizing and secreting the tumor tissue sialoglycoproteins and confirmed that the more aggressive, fibrotic breast cancer subtypes expressed the highest levels of sialoglycoprotein biosynthetic genes. The more aggressive breast cancer subtypes also featured greater infiltration of immunosuppressive <i>SIGLEC7</i>, <i>SIGLEC9</i>, and <i>SIGLEC10</i>-pos myeloid cells, indicating that triple-negative breast tumors had higher expression of both immunosuppressive Siglec receptors and their cognate ligands. The findings link sialoglycoprotein biosynthesis and secretion to tumor fibrosis and aggression in human breast tumors. The data suggest targeting of the sialic acid-Siglec axis may comprise an attractive therapeutic target particularly for the more aggressive HER2+ and triple-negative breast cancer subtypes.","CRISPR, Trichrome Staining Method, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing, Alcian Blue Staining Method, Picrosirius Staining, Immunofluorescent Staining Method",Breast Neoplasm ,Breast,,Open Access,35392183,eec116f6-bc3c-4c19-b1a6-c4731344f393,syn52566224

A greater abundance of aligned fibrillar collagen is characteristic of invasive and aggressive breast cancers and has been associated with elevated activity of collagen crosslinking enzymes, such as lysyl oxidase (LOX) and lysyl hydroxylases (LH) and the formation of more mature collagen matrix crosslinks. Aligned collagen fibers can facilitate metastatic dissemination of tumor cells, and LOX inhibitors have been used to inhibit tumor progression and metastasis in experimental models. Thus, a better understanding of how matrix crosslinking alters tumor cell phenotypes, and behaviors would improve our ability to effectively treat aggressive metastatic breast cancer. Herein described is an experimental approach to glycate and crosslink a collagen-I/basement membrane extract ECM to study the impact of ECM crosslinking on mammary tumor progression in vivo. Moreover, glycation of collagen by sugars to form advanced glycation end products naturally occurs during aging, extending the potential relevance of this approach to research on mechanisms of aging involved in disease progression.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,36587129,fe618476-b899-4fff-8f41-0c226db71203,syn52566224
