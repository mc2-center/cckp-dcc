However, the mechanisms of tumor induction of these enzymes are unclear. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed correlations between NOS2 and COX2 expression and Th1 cytokines. Herein, single-cell RNAseq analysis of TNBC cells shows potent NOS2 and COX2 indu(Read more on Pubmed)","Cell Culture, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing, Scratch Assay, Invasion Assay",Breast Carcinoma,Breast,,Open Access,37169743

However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Herein, we characterized breast and lung cancer-induced BME shifts pre- and post-tumor removal. Remote tumors progressively lead to osteoprogenitor (OP) expansion, hematopoietic stem cell dislocation, and CD41<s(Read more on Pubmed)",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,37146584
