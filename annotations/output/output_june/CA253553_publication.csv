However, the mechanisms of tumor induction of these enzymes are unclear. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed correlations between NOS2 and COX2 expression and Th1 cytokines. Herein, single-cell RNAseq analysis of TNBC cells shows potent NOS2 and COX2 induction by IFNγ combined with IL1β or TNFα. Given that IFNγ is secreted by cytolytic lymphocytes, which improve clinical outcomes, this role of IFNγ presents a dichotomy. To explore this conundrum, tumor NOS2, COX2, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were spatially analyzed in aggressive ER-, TNBC, and HER2 + breast tumors. High expression and clustering of NOS2-expressing tumor cells occurred at the tumor/stroma interface in the presence of stroma-restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. High expression and clustering of COX2-expressing tumor cells extended into immune desert regions in the tumor core where CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell penetration was limited or absent. Moreover, high NOS2-expressing tumor cells were proximal to areas with increased satellitosis, suggestive of cell clusters with a higher metastatic potential. Further in vitro experiments revealed that IFNγ + IL1β/TNFα increased the elongation and migration of treated tumor cells. This spatial analysis of the tumor microenvironment provides important insight into distinct neighborhoods where stroma-restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells exist proximal to NOS2-expressing tumor niches that could have increased metastatic potential.","Cell Culture, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing, Scratch Assay, Invasion Assay",Breast Carcinoma,Breast,,Open Access,37169743,827eadc1-7cb6-4673-bb3e-d08f8fa5c367,syn52566239

However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Herein, we characterized breast and lung cancer-induced BME shifts pre- and post-tumor removal. Remote tumors progressively lead to osteoprogenitor (OP) expansion, hematopoietic stem cell dislocation, and CD41<sup>-</sup> granulocyte-monocyte progenitor (GMP) aggregation. The tumor-entrained BME is characterized by co-localization between CD41<sup>-</sup> GMPs and OPs. OP ablation abolishes this effect and diminishes abnormal myeloid overproduction. Mechanistically, HTRA1 carried by tumor-derived small extracellular vesicles upregulates MMP-13 in OPs, which in turn induces the alterations in the hematopoietic program. Importantly, these effects persist post-surgery and continue to impair anti-tumor immunity. Conditional knockout or inhibition of MMP-13 accelerates immune reinstatement and restores the efficacies of immunotherapies. Therefore, tumor-induced systemic effects are initiated by OP-GMP crosstalk that outlasts tumor burden, and additional treatment is required to reverse these effects for optimal therapeutic efficacy.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,37146584,85c822fd-cbc2-4b05-a740-cab4d2f5d6c8,syn52566239
