To investigate this, we developed a live-cell method to measure changes in chromosome numbers. We edited constitutive genes with GFP/RFP-tags on single alleles and discovered that cells that lose Chromosome-reporters (ChReporters) become non-fluorescent. We applied our new tool(Read more on Pubmed)",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,37158012

FDs are phase-separated liquids with a poorly understood interfacial tension Î³ that determines how FDs interact with other organelles. Here, micron-sized FDs remain spherical as they indent peri-nuclear actomyosin and the nucleus, while causing local di(Read more on Pubmed)",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,37212777
