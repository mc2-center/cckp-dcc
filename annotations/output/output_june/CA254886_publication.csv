To investigate this, we developed a live-cell method to measure changes in chromosome numbers. We edited constitutive genes with GFP/RFP-tags on single alleles and discovered that cells that lose Chromosome-reporters (ChReporters) become non-fluorescent. We applied our new tools to confined mitosis and to inhibition of the putative tumor suppressor Myosin-II. We quantified compression of mitotic chromatin in vivo and demonstrated that similar compression in vitro resulted in cell death, but also rare and heritable ChReptorter loss. Myosin-II suppression rescued lethal multipolar divisions and maximized ChReporter loss in 3D-compression and 2D-confinement, but not in standard 2D-culture. ChReporter loss associated with chromosome mis-segregation, rather than just the number of divisions, and loss in vitro and in mice was selected against in subsequent 2D-cultures. Inhibition of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) caused ChReporter loss in 2D, as expected, but not in 3D-compression, suggesting a SAC perturbation. Thus, confinement and myosin-II affect DNA sequence and mechano-evolution, and ChReporters enable diverse studies of viable genetic changes.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,37158012,54ecc959-d434-4e62-a6af-38f8a609b325,syn52566240

FDs are phase-separated liquids with a poorly understood interfacial tension γ that determines how FDs interact with other organelles. Here, micron-sized FDs remain spherical as they indent peri-nuclear actomyosin and the nucleus, while causing local dilution of Lamin-B1 independent of Lamin-A,C and sometimes triggering nuclear rupture. Focal accumulation of the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS at the rupture site is accompanied by sustained mislocalization of DNA repair factors to cytoplasm, increased DNA damage, and delayed cell cycle. Macrophages show FDs and engulfed rigid beads cause similar indentation dilution. Spherical shapes of small FDs indicate a high γ, which we measure for FDs mechanically isolated from fresh adipose tissue as ∼40 mN/m. This value is far higher than that of protein condensates, but typical of oils in water and sufficiently rigid to perturb cell structures including nuclei.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,37212777,ffa8dc0f-a99e-4a63-a041-e9f53f254ce4,syn52566240
