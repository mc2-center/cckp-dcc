This review discusses the studies presented at the third annual meeting of the Melanoma Research Foundation in the context of other recent reports on the biology and treatment of melanoma brain metastases (MBM). Although symptomatic MBM patients were historically excluded from immunotherapy trials, efforts from clinicians and patient advocates have resulted in more inclusive and even dedicated clinical trials for MBM patients. The results of checkpoint inhibitor trials were discussed in conversation with current standards of care for MBM patients, including steroids, radiotherapy, and targeted therapy. Advances in the basic scientific understanding of MBM, including the role of astrocytes and metabolic adaptations to the brain microenvironment, are exposing new vulnerabilities which could be exploited for therapeutic purposes. Technical advances including single-cell omics and multiplex imaging are expanding our understanding of the MBM ecosystem and its response to therapy. This unprecedented level of spatial and temporal resolution is expected to dramatically advance the field in the coming years and render novel treatment approaches that might improve MBM patient outcomes.","Single Cell RNA-Sequencing, Multiplexed Immunofluorescence",Melanoma,Skin,,Open Access,35912544,59606768-d401-4edb-b2ef-2e30a64b2c50,syn52566257

Solar UV exposure transforms melanocytes into highly mutated tumor cells that metastasize to the liver, lungs, and brain. Even upon resection of the primary tumor, almost thirty percent of patients succumb to melanoma within twenty years. Identification of key melanoma genetic drivers led to the development of pharmacological BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> and MEK inhibitors, significantly improving metastatic patient outcomes over traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy or pioneering IFN-Î± and IL-2 immune therapies. Checkpoint blockade inhibitors releasing the immunosuppressive effects of CTLA-4 or PD-1 proved to be even more effective and are the standard first-line treatment. Despite these major improvements, durable responses to immunotherapy and targeted therapy have been hindered by intrinsic or acquired resistance. In addition to gained or selected genetic alterations, cellular plasticity conferred by epigenetic reprogramming is emerging as a driver of therapy resistance. Epigenetic regulation of chromatin accessibility drives gene expression and establishes distinct transcriptional cell states. Here we review how aberrant chromatin, transcriptional, and epigenetic regulation contribute to therapy resistance and discuss how targeting these programs sensitizes melanoma cells to immune and targeted therapies.","Targeted Therapy Agent, Immunotherapy",Melanoma,Not Applicable,,Open Access,36497341,d4e93b35-9a19-4221-a7ee-1d8c4221b9d9,syn52566257

Here we show that tumor-associated lymphatic vessels control T cell exit from tumors via the chemokine CXCL12, and intratumoral antigen encounter tunes CXCR4 expression by effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Only high-affinity antigen downregulates CXCR4 and upregulates the CXCL12 decoy receptor, ACKR3, thereby reducing CXCL12 sensitivity and promoting T cell retention. A diverse repertoire of functional tumor-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, therefore, exit the tumor, which limits the pool of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells available to exert tumor control. CXCR4 inhibition or loss of lymphatic-specific CXCL12 boosts T cell retention and enhances tumor control. These data indicate that strategies to limit T cell egress might be an approach to boost the quantity and quality of intratumoral T cells and thereby response to immunotherapy.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,PRJNA903884,Restricted Access,36849745,0b43e5d9-7d9a-4d2f-828b-1f2b839186ca,syn52566257
