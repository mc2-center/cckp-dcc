This technology enables unprecedented in situ resolution of the regulatory pathways that underlie the heterogeneity in the tumor as well as the tumor microenvironment (TME). The direct characterization of cellular co-localization with spatial technologies facilities quantification of the molecular changes resulting from direct cell-cell interaction, as it occurs in tumor-immune interactions. We present SpaceMarkers, a bioinformatics algorithm to infer molecular changes from cell-cell interactions from latent space analysis of ST data. We apply this approach to infer the molecular changes from tumor-immune interactions in Visium spatial transcriptomics data of metastasis, invasive and precursor lesions, and immunotherapy treatment. Further transfer learning in matched scRNA-seq data enabled further quantification of the specific cell types in which SpaceMarkers are enriched. Altogether, SpaceMarkers can identify the location and context-specific molecular interactions within the TME from ST data.","Visium Spatial Gene Expression, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,,Restricted Access,37080163,5fb530d2-8fdc-4184-84f3-24eff3f99bb8,syn52566267
