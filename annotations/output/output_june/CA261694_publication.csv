As such, clinical studies have provided evidence that markers associated with elevated levels of coagulation and fibrinolysis correlate with decreased patient survival. However, elucidating the mechanisms underpinning the effects of different components of the coa(Read more on Pubmed)",,,,,Open Access,37119127

Individual podosomes probe their microenvironment through periodic protrusion and retraction cycles (height oscillations), while oscillations of multiple podosomes in a cluster are coordinated in a wave-like fashion.

The resulting bioenergetic stress leads to signaling and metabolic adaptation responses in tumor cells, secures survival, and adjusts migration activity. The kinetic responses of cancer cells to energy deficit were recently identified, including a switch of invasive c(Read more on Pubmed)",3D Cell Culture,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,,Open Access,36328835
