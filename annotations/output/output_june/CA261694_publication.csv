As such, clinical studies have provided evidence that markers associated with elevated levels of coagulation and fibrinolysis correlate with decreased patient survival. However, elucidating the mechanisms underpinning the effects of different components of the coagulation system on metastasis formation is challenging both in animal models and 2D models lacking the complex cellular interactions necessary to model both thrombosis and metastasis. Here, an in vitro, 3D, microvascular model for observing the formation of fibrin thrombi is described, which is in turn used to study how different aspects of the hypercoagulable state associated with cancer affect the endothelium. Using this platform, cancer cells expressing ICAM-1 are shown to form a fibrinogen-dependent bridge and transmigrate through the endothelium more effectively. Cancer cells are also demonstrated to interact with fibrin thrombi, using them to adhere, spread, and enhance their extravasation efficiency. Finally, thrombin is also shown to enhance cancer cell extravasation. This system presents a physiologically relevant model of fibrin clot formation in the human microvasculature, enabling in-depth investigation of the cellular interactions between cancer cells and the coagulation system affecting cancer cell extravasation.",,,,,Open Access,37119127,30b410ff-b7dc-4a1c-b1f7-d22f485b7bdf,syn52566248

Individual podosomes probe their microenvironment through periodic protrusion and retraction cycles (height oscillations), while oscillations of multiple podosomes in a cluster are coordinated in a wave-like fashion. However, the mechanisms governing both the individual oscillations and the collective wave-like dynamics remain unclear. Here, by integrating actin polymerization, myosin contractility, actin diffusion, and mechanosensitive signaling, we develop a chemo-mechanical model for podosome dynamics in clusters. Our model reveals that podosomes show oscillatory growth when actin polymerization-driven protrusion and signaling-associated myosin contraction occur at similar rates, while the diffusion of actin monomers drives wave-like coordination of podosome oscillations. Our theoretical predictions are validated by different pharmacological treatments and the impact of microenvironment stiffness on chemo-mechanical waves. Our proposed framework can shed light on the role of podosomes in immune cell mechanosensing within the context of wound healing and cancer immunotherapy.",Mathematical Modeling,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,,Open Access,37217555,e5a1399e-7cde-4bda-b0be-dfbc96329130,syn52566248

The resulting bioenergetic stress leads to signaling and metabolic adaptation responses in tumor cells, secures survival, and adjusts migration activity. The kinetic responses of cancer cells to energy deficit were recently identified, including a switch of invasive cancer cells to energy-conservative amoeboid migration and an enhanced capability for distant metastasis. We review the energy programs employed by different cancer invasion modes including collective, mesenchymal, and amoeboid migration, as well as their interconversion in response to energy deprivation, and we discuss the consequences for metastatic escape. Understanding the energy requirements of amoeboid and other dissemination strategies offers rationales for improving therapeutic targeting of metastatic cancer progression.",3D Cell Culture,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,,Open Access,36328835,4ec5fd70-c12d-4f59-80c3-7efa2af9cec8,syn52566248
