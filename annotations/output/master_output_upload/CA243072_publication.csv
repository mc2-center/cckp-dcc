Many studies investigating the link between trisomy 21 and leukemia initiation and progression have been conducted over the last two decades. Despite improved treatment regimens and significant progress in iden - tifying genes on chromosome 21 and the mechanisms by which they drive leukemogenesis, there is still much that is unknown. A focused group of scientists and clinicians with expertise in leukemia and DS met in October 2022 at the J√©r√¥me Lejeune Foundation in Paris, France for the 1st International Symposium on Down Syndrome and Leukemia. This meeting was held to discuss the most recent advances in treatment regimens and the biology underlying the initiation, progression, and relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia in children with DS. This review provides a summary of what is known in the field, challenges in the management of DS patients with leukemia, and key questions in the field.",Modeling,"B Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Myeloid Leukemia",Blood,Not Appicable,Open Access,,,,37439336
