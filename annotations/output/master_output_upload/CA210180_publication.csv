To investigate metabolic adaptations in the neuron-enriched dentate granule cell (DGC) layer within its native tissue environment, we employed murine acute hippocampal brain slices, coupled with fast metabolite preservation and followed by mass spectrometry (MS) imaging, to generate spatially resolved metabolomics and isotope-tracing data. Here we show that membrane depolarization induces broad metabolic changes, including increased glycolytic activity in DGCs. Increased glucose metabolism in response to stimulation is accompanied by mobilization of endogenous inosine into pentose phosphates via the action of purine nucleotide phosphorylase (PNP). The PNP reaction is an integral part of the neuronal response to stimulation, because inhibition of PNP leaves DGCs energetically impaired during recovery from strong activation. Performing MS imaging on brain slices bridges the gap between live-cell physiology and the deep chemical analysis enabled by MS.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,,,,37798473

Here we develop a study based on correlating the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained biopsy data with MALDI mass-spectrometric imaging data of the corresponding tissue to determine the cancerous regions and their unique chemical signatures and variations of the predicted regions with original pathological annotations. We obtain features from high-resolution optical micrographs of whole slide H&E stained data through deep learning and spatially register them with mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) data to correlate the chemical signature with the tissue anatomy of the data. We then use the learned correlation to predict prostate cancer from observed H&E images using trained coregistered MSI data. This multimodal approach can predict cancerous regions with ∼80% accuracy, which indicates a correlation between optical H&E features and chemical information found in MSI. We show that such paired multimodal data can be used for training feature extraction networks on H&E data which bypasses the need to acquire expensive MSI data and eliminates the need for manual annotation saving valuable time. Two chemical biomarkers were also found to be predicting the ground truth cancerous regions. This study shows promise in generating improved patient treatment trajectories by predicting prostate cancer directly from readily available H&E-stained biopsy images aided by coregistered MSI data.","Deep Learning, Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method, MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry",Prostate Neoplasm,Prostate Gland,Not Applicable,Open Access,,,,36625762

Previous models have elucidated interactions between EGFR and downstream adaptor proteins or showed phenotypes affected by EGFR. However, the link between specific EGFR phosphorylation sites and phenotypic outcomes is still poorly understood. Here, we employed a suite of isogenic cell lines expressing site-specific mutations at each of the EGFR C-terminal phosphorylation sites to interrogate their role in the signaling network and cell biological response to stimulation. Our results demonstrate the resilience of the EGFR network, which was largely similar even in the context of multiple Y-to-F mutations in the EGFR C-terminal tail, while also revealing nodes in the network that have not previously been linked to EGFR signaling. Our data-driven model highlights the signaling network nodes associated with distinct EGF-driven cell responses, including migration, proliferation, and receptor trafficking. Application of this same approach to less-studied RTKs should provide a plethora of novel associations that should lead to an improved understanding of these signaling networks.","Plasmid Construction, Flow Cytometry, Cell Culture, Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry, Cell Proliferation Assay, Migration Assay",,Not Applicable,PXD032403,Open Access,Pan-cancer,,,37169593

It remains unknown if blood-brain barrier disruption merely reflects or functionally supports glioma aggressiveness. We utilised intra-operative microdialysis to sample the extracellular metabolome of radiographically diverse regions of gliomas and evaluated the global extracellular metabolome via ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Among 162 named metabolites, guanidinoacetate (GAA) was 126.32x higher in enhancing tumour than in adjacent brain. 48 additional metabolites were 2.05-10.18x more abundant in enhancing tumour than brain. With exception of GAA, and 2-hydroxyglutarate in IDH-mutant gliomas, differences between non-enhancing tumour and brain microdialysate were modest and less consistent. The enhancing, but not the non-enhancing glioma metabolome, was significantly enriched for plasma-associated metabolites largely comprising amino acids and carnitines. Our findings suggest that metabolite diffusion through a disrupted blood-brain barrier may largely define the enhancing extracellular glioma metabolome. Future studies will determine how the altered extracellular metabolome impacts glioma behaviour.","Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis",,Brain,Not Applicable,Open Access,"Glioblastoma, Glioma",,,37340056
