The VMT forms de novo within a microfluidic platform by co-culture of multiple human cell types under dynamic, physiological flow conditions. This tissue-engineered micro-tumor construct incorporates a living perfused vascular network that supports the growing tumor mass just as newly formed vessels do in vivo. Importantly, drugs and immune cells must cross the endothelial layer to reach the tumor, modeling in vivo physiological barriers to therapeutic delivery and efficacy. Since the VMT platform is optically transparent, high-resolution imaging of dynamic processes such as immune cell extravasation and metastasis can be achieved with direct visualization of fluorescently labeled cells within the tissue. Further, the VMT retains in vivo tumor heterogeneity, gene expression signatures, and drug responses. Virtually any tumor type can be adapted to the platform, and primary cells from fresh surgical tissues grow and respond to drug treatment in the VMT, paving the way toward truly personalized medicine. Here, the methods for establishing the VMT and utilizing it for oncology research are outlined. This innovative approach opens new possibilities for studying tumors and drug responses, providing researchers with a powerful tool to advance cancer research.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,,,,37782104

The Tissue Imager can immediately be deployed on benchtops for in situ protein detection in tissue samples. Applications for this device are broad, ranging from answering basic biological questions to clinical pathology, where immunofluorescence can detect a larger number of markers than the standard H&E or chromogenic immunohistochemistry (CIH) staining, while the low cost also allows usage in classrooms. After characterizing our platform's specificity and sensitivity, we demonstrate imaging of a 4-plex immunology panel in human cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples. From those images, positive cells were detected using CellProfiler, a popular open-source software package, for tumor marker profiling. We achieved a performance on par with commercial epifluorescence microscopes that are >10 times more expensive than our Tissue Imager. This device enables rapid immunofluorescence detection in tissue sections at a low cost for scientists and clinicians and can provide students with a hands-on experience to understand engineering and instrumentation. We note that for using the Tissue Imager as a medical device in clinical settings, a comprehensive review and approval processes would be required.",Multiplexed Immunofluorescence,Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma,Skin,Not Applicable,Open Access,,,,37108170
