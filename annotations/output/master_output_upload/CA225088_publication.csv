Among the hallmarks of aging, changes in host and cellular metabolism critically affect the development, maintenance, and function of T¬†cells. Although metabolic perturbations impact anti-tumor T¬†cell responses, the link between age-associated metabolic dysfunction and anti-tumor immunity remains unclear. In this review, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of aged T¬†cell metabolism, with a focus on the bioenergetic and immunologic features of T¬†cell subsets unique to the aging process. We also survey insights into mechanisms of metabolic T¬†cell dysfunction in aging and discuss the impacts of aging on the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. As the average life expectancy continues to increase, understanding the interplay between age-related metabolic reprogramming and maladaptive T¬†cell immunity will be instrumental for the development of therapeutic strategies for older patients.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,,,,36473467
