To fully appreciate gene functions in a given cell type, one needs to understand how much, when and where the gene is expressed. Classic bulk RNA sequencing and popular single cell sequencing destroy cell structural organization and fail to provide spatial information. However, the spatial location of gene expression or of the cell in a complex tissue provides key clues to comprehend how the neighboring genes or cells cross talk, transduce signals and work together as a team to complete the job. The functional requirement for the spatial content has been a driving force for rapid development of the spatial transcriptomics technologies in the past few years. Here, we present an overview of current spatial technologies with a special focus on the commercially available or currently being commercialized technologies, highlight their applications by category and discuss experimental considerations for a first spatial experiment.","Visium Spatial Gene Expression, Multiplexed Error-Robust Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Appicable,Open Access,,,,37353093
