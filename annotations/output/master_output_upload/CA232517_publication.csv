It plays crucial roles in all aspects of life - from orchestrating cell migration during development, to supporting tissue repair. It also plays critical roles in the etiology or progression of diseases. To study this compartment, we have previously defined the compendium of all genes encoding ECM and ECM-associated proteins for multiple organisms. We termed this compendium the 'matrisome' and further classified matrisome components into different structural or functional categories. This nomenclature is now largely adopted by the research community to annotate '-omics' datasets and has contributed to advance both fundamental and translational ECM research. Here, we report the development of Matrisome AnalyzeR, a suite of tools including a web-based application and an R package. The web application can be used by anyone interested in annotating, classifying and tabulating matrisome molecules in large datasets without requiring programming knowledge. The companion R package is available to more experienced users, interested in processing larger datasets or in additional data visualization options.",Computational Tool,Breast Neoplasm,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,,,,37555624
