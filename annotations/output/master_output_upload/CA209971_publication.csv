Here, we took a structure-based approach to decoupling IFNŒ≥ pleiotropy. We engineered an affinity-enhanced variant of the ligand-binding chain of the IFNŒ≥ receptor IFNŒ≥R1, which enabled us to determine the crystal structure of the complete hexameric (2:2:2) IFNŒ≥-IFNŒ≥R1-IFNŒ≥R2 signalling complex at 3.25¬†√Ö resolution. The structure reveals the mechanism underlying deficits in IFNŒ≥ responsiveness in mycobacterial disease syndrome resulting from a T168N mutation in IFNŒ≥R2, which impairs assembly of the full signalling complex. The topology of the hexameric complex offers a blueprint for engineering IFNŒ≥ variants to tune IFNŒ≥ receptor signalling output. Unexpectedly, we found that several partial IFNŒ≥ agonists exhibited biased gene-expression profiles. These biased agonists retained the ability to induce upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class I antigen expression, but exhibited impaired induction of programmed death-ligand 1 expression in a wide range of human cancer cell lines, offering a route to decoupling immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive functions of IFNŒ≥ for therapeutic applications.","Mass Spectrometry, Next Generation Sequencing, Surface Plasmon Resonance",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,GSE122672,Open Access,,,,30814731
