Moreover, epigenomic alterations can now be measured at multiple scales of analysis and are detectable in human tumors or liquid biopsies. Malignant cell clones with a proclivity for relapse in certain organs may arise in the primary tumor as a consequence of epigenomic alterations which cause a loss in lineage integrity. These alterations may occur due to genetic aberrations acquired during tumor progression or concomitant to therapeutic response. Moreover, evolution of the stroma can also alter the epigenome of cancer cells. In this review, we highlight current knowledge with a particular emphasis on leveraging chromatin and DNA modifying mechanisms as biomarkers of disseminated disease and as therapeutic targets to treat metastatic cancers.",Targeted Therapy Agent,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Appicable,Open Access,,,,37286865

Here, we define the chromatin accessibility and gene regulatory signatures of osimertinib sensitive and resistant EGFR-mutant cell and patient-derived models and uncover a role for mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes in TKI resistance. By profiling mSWI/SNF genome-wide localization, we identify both shared and cancer cell line-specific gene targets underlying the resistant state. Importantly, genetic and pharmacologic disruption of the SMARCA4/SMARCA2 mSWI/SNF ATPases re-sensitizes a subset of resistant models to osimertinib via inhibition of mSWI/SNF-mediated regulation of cellular programs governing cell proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, epithelial cell differentiation, and NRF2 signaling. These data highlight the role of mSWI/SNF complexes in supporting TKI resistance and suggest potential utility of mSWI/SNF inhibitors in TKI-resistant lung cancers.","Whole Exome Sequencing, RNA Sequencing, ATAC-Seq, CUT&RUN",,Lung,"GSE202864, GSE202863, GSE202859, GSE202857, GSE227999",Open Access,Lung Adenocarcinoma,,,37541244
