The method is based on the transport of a bifunctional substrate comprised of an antigen fused to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, which allows positive selection of bacterial cells co-expressing cytoplasmic IgGs called cyclonals that specifically capture the chimeric antigen and sequester the antibiotic resistance marker in the cytoplasm. The utility of this approach is first demonstrated by isolating affinity-matured cyclonal variants that specifically bind their cognate antigen, the leucine zipper domain of a yeast transcriptional activator, with subnanomolar affinities, which represent a ~20-fold improvement over the parental IgG. We then use the genetic assay to discover antigen-specific cyclonals from a na√Øve human antibody repertoire, leading to the identification of lead IgG candidates with affinity and specificity for an influenza hemagglutinin-derived peptide antigen.","Plasmid Construction, ELISA",,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,Not Applicable,,,37316535

The resulting bioenergetic stress leads to signaling and metabolic adaptation responses in tumor cells, secures survival, and adjusts migration activity. The kinetic responses of cancer cells to energy deficit were recently identified, including a switch of invasive cancer cells to energy-conservative amoeboid migration and an enhanced capability for distant metastasis. We review the energy programs employed by different cancer invasion modes including collective, mesenchymal, and amoeboid migration, as well as their interconversion in response to energy deprivation, and we discuss the consequences for metastatic escape. Understanding the energy requirements of amoeboid and other dissemination strategies offers rationales for improving therapeutic targeting of metastatic cancer progression.",Modeling,,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,Pan-cancer,,,36328835
