Here, we investigate how populations with non-genetic fitness variation cross fitness valleys, common barriers to adaptation in rugged fitness landscapes in which a population must pass through a deleterious intermediate to arrive at a final advantageous stage. We develop a stochastic computational model describing the dynamics of an asexually reproducing population crossing a fitness valley, in which individuals of the same evolutionary stage can have variable fitnesses. We find that fitness variation that persists over multiple generations increases the rate of valley crossing through a novel evolutionary mechanism different from previously characterized mechanisms such as stochastic tunneling. By reducing the strength of selection against deleterious intermediates, persistent fitness variation allows for faster adaptation through rugged fitness landscapes.",Computational Modeling,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,,,,30272027

However, current treatment protocols do not account for this plasticity. Previously, we generated a mathematical model based on preclinical experiments to describe this process and optimize a radiation therapy fractionation schedule that substantially increased survival relative to standard fractionation in a murine glioblastoma model. Methods: We developed statistical models to predict the survival benefit of interventions to glioblastoma patients based on the corresponding survival benefit in the mouse model used in our preclinical study. We applied our mathematical model of glioblastoma radiation response to optimize a radiation therapy fractionation schedule for patients undergoing re-irradiation for glioblastoma and developed a first-in-human trial (NCT03557372) to assess the feasibility and safety of administering our schedule. Results: Our statistical modeling predicted that the hazard ratio when comparing our novel radiation schedule with a standard schedule would be 0.74. Our mathematical modeling suggested that a practical, near-optimal schedule for re-irradiation of recurrent glioblastoma patients was 3.96 Gy × 7 (1 fraction/day) followed by 1.0 Gy × 9 (3 fractions/day). Our optimized schedule was successfully administered to 14/14 (100%) patients. Conclusions: A novel radiation therapy schedule based on mathematical modeling of cell-state plasticity is feasible and safe to administer to glioblastoma patients.",Mathematical Modeling,,Brain,Not Applicable,Open Access,Glioblastoma,,,36402744
