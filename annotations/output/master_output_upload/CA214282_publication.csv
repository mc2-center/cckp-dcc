These modifications can have an impact on various pathways, including host antiviral immune responses. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of epigenetic modifications induced by viruses to counteract host antiviral immune responses, which are crucial for establishing and maintaining infection of viruses. Finally, we provide insights into the potential use of epigenetic modulators in combating viral infections and virus-induced diseases.",Targeted Therapy Agent,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,,,,37656959
