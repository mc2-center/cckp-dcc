Over the years, several innovative approaches in BBB opening and drug delivery have been developed and progressed into clinical testing phases, including focused ultrasound (FUS) with circulating microbubbles, mannitol-facilitated delivery of anti-neoplastic drugs, receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) by antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), and viral vectors for gene therapy. We provided a comprehensive review of the most recent clinical applications of these approaches in managing brain tumors and Alzheimer's disease (AD), two major devastating brain diseases. Moreover, the spatial-temporal molecular heterogeneity of the BBB under disease states emphasized the importance of utilizing emerging spatial systems biology approaches to unravel novel targets for intervention within BBB and tailor strategies for enhancing drug delivery to the brain. SEARCH STRATEGY AND SELECTION CRITERIA: Data for this Review were identified by searches of clinicaltrials.gov, MEDLINE, Current Contents, PubMed, and references from relevant articles using the search terms ""blood-brain barrier"", ""CNS drug delivery"", ""BBB modulation"", ""clinical trials"", ""systems biology"", ""primary or metastatic brain tumors"", ""Alzheimer's disease"". Abstracts and reports from meetings were included only when they related directly to previously published work. Only articles published in English between 1980 and 2023 were included.","Ultrasound Imaging, Imaging",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,,,,37703663

Herein, single-cell RNAseq analysis of TNBC cells shows potent NOS2 and COX2 induction by IFNγ combined with IL1β or TNFα. Given that IFNγ is secreted by cytolytic lymphocytes, which improve clinical outcomes, this role of IFNγ presents a dichotomy. To explore this conundrum, tumor NOS2, COX2, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were spatially analyzed in aggressive ER-, TNBC, and HER2 + breast tumors. High expression and clustering of NOS2-expressing tumor cells occurred at the tumor/stroma interface in the presence of stroma-restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. High expression and clustering of COX2-expressing tumor cells extended into immune desert regions in the tumor core where CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell penetration was limited or absent. Moreover, high NOS2-expressing tumor cells were proximal to areas with increased satellitosis, suggestive of cell clusters with a higher metastatic potential. Further in vitro experiments revealed that IFNγ + IL1β/TNFα increased the elongation and migration of treated tumor cells. This spatial analysis of the tumor microenvironment provides important insight into distinct neighborhoods where stroma-restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells exist proximal to NOS2-expressing tumor niches that could have increased metastatic potential.","Cell Culture, Scratch Assay, Invasion Assay, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing, Immunohistochemistry Staining Method",,Breast,Not Applicable,Open Access,"Breast Adenocarcinoma, Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma",,,37169743

Because of substantial interobserver variability in the application of the BI-RADS lexicon, the decision to biopsy varies greatly and results in overdiagnosis and excessive biopsies. The false-positive rate from mammograms is estimated to be 7% to approximately 10% overall, but within the BI-RADS 4 category, it is greater than 70%. Therefore, we developed the Breast Cancer Risk Calculator (BRISK) to target a well-characterized and specific patient subgroup (BI-RADS 4) rather than a broad heterogeneous group in assessing breast cancer risk. Methods: BRISK provides a novel precise risk assessment model to reduce overdiagnosis and unnecessary biopsies. It was developed by applying natural language processing and deep learning methods on 5,147 patient records archived in the Houston Methodist systemwide data warehouse from 2006 to May 2015, including imaging and pathology reports, mammographic images, and patient demographics. Key characteristics for BI-RADS 4 patients were collected and computed to output an index measure for biopsy recommendation that is clinically relevant and informative and improves upon the traditional BI-RADS 4 scores. Results: For the validation set, we assessed data from 1,247 BI-RADS 4 patients, including mammographic images and medical reports. The BRISK model sensitivity to predict malignancy was 100%, whereas the specificity was 74%. The total accuracy of our implemented model in BRISK was 81%. Overall area under the curve was 0.93. Conclusion: BRISK for abnormal mammogram uses integrative artificial intelligence technology and has demonstrated high sensitivity in the prediction of malignancy. Prospective evaluation is under way and can lead to improvement in patient-physician engagement in making informed decisions with regard to biopsy.","Computational Tool, Computational Modeling",,Breast,Not Applicable,Open Access,Breast Neoplasm,,https://bcrisktool.cancer.gov/,31141423
