Current dogma states that McSCs are reserved in an undifferentiated state in the hair follicle niche, physically segregated from differentiated progeny that migrate away following cues of regenerative stimuli<sup>4-8</sup>. Here we show that most McSCs toggle between transit-amplifying and stem cell states for both self-renewal and generation of mature progeny, a mechanism fundamentally distinct from those of other self-renewing systems. Live imaging and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that McSCs are mobile, translocating between hair follicle stem cell and transit-amplifying compartments where they reversibly enter distinct differentiation states governed by local microenvironmental cues (for example, WNT). Long-term lineage tracing demonstrated that the McSC system is maintained by reverted McSCs rather than by reserved stem cells inherently exempt from reversible changes. During ageing, there is accumulation of stranded McSCs that do not contribute to the regeneration of melanocyte progeny. These results identify a new model whereby dedifferentiation is integral to homeostatic stem cell maintenance and suggest that modulating McSC mobility may represent a new approach for the prevention of hair greying.","Imaging, Immunofluorescent Staining Method, In Situ Hybridization, Microscopy, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis",Melanoma,Skin,"GSE203051,  GSE113502",Open Access,,,,37076619

Solar UV exposure transforms melanocytes into highly mutated tumor cells that metastasize to the liver, lungs, and brain. Even upon resection of the primary tumor, almost thirty percent of patients succumb to melanoma within twenty years. Identification of key melanoma genetic drivers led to the development of pharmacological BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> and MEK inhibitors, significantly improving metastatic patient outcomes over traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy or pioneering IFN-Î± and IL-2 immune therapies. Checkpoint blockade inhibitors releasing the immunosuppressive effects of CTLA-4 or PD-1 proved to be even more effective and are the standard first-line treatment. Despite these major improvements, durable responses to immunotherapy and targeted therapy have been hindered by intrinsic or acquired resistance. In addition to gained or selected genetic alterations, cellular plasticity conferred by epigenetic reprogramming is emerging as a driver of therapy resistance. Epigenetic regulation of chromatin accessibility drives gene expression and establishes distinct transcriptional cell states. Here we review how aberrant chromatin, transcriptional, and epigenetic regulation contribute to therapy resistance and discuss how targeting these programs sensitizes melanoma cells to immune and targeted therapies.",Immunotherapy,,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,Melanoma,,,36497341

This review discusses the studies presented at the third annual meeting of the Melanoma Research Foundation in the context of other recent reports on the biology and treatment of melanoma brain metastases (MBM). Although symptomatic MBM patients were historically excluded from immunotherapy trials, efforts from clinicians and patient advocates have resulted in more inclusive and even dedicated clinical trials for MBM patients. The results of checkpoint inhibitor trials were discussed in conversation with current standards of care for MBM patients, including steroids, radiotherapy, and targeted therapy. Advances in the basic scientific understanding of MBM, including the role of astrocytes and metabolic adaptations to the brain microenvironment, are exposing new vulnerabilities which could be exploited for therapeutic purposes. Technical advances including single-cell omics and multiplex imaging are expanding our understanding of the MBM ecosystem and its response to therapy. This unprecedented level of spatial and temporal resolution is expected to dramatically advance the field in the coming years and render novel treatment approaches that might improve MBM patient outcomes.","Single Cell RNA-Sequencing, Multiplexed Immunofluorescence",,Skin,,Open Access,Melanoma,,,35912544
