However, the approach remains challenging, with blockade of the macrophage checkpoint CD47 working in immunodeficient mice and against highly immunogenic tumors but not in the clinic where tumors are poorly immunogenic. Even when mouse tumors of poorly immunogenic B16F10 melanoma are opsonized to drive engulfment with a suitable monoclonal antibody (mAb), anti-CD47 blockade remains insufficient. Using both in vitro immuno-tumoroids and in vivo mouse models, we show with CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) that a relatively uniform minimum repression of CD47 by 80% is needed for phagocytosis to dominate net growth when combined with an otherwise ineffective mAb (anti-Tyrp1). Heterogeneity enriches for CD47-high cells, but mice that eliminate tumors generate prophagocytic IgGs that increase in titer with CD47 repression and with tumor accumulation of macrophages, although deeper repression does not improve survival. Given well-known limitations of antibody permeation into solid tumors, our studies clarify benchmarks for CD47 disruption that should be more clinically feasible and safer but just as effective as complete ablation. Additionally, safe but ineffective opsonization in human melanoma trials suggests that combinations with deep repression of CD47 could prove effective and initiate durable immunity.","Flow Cytometry, Immunotherapy",Melanoma,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,,,,37593202

To investigate this, we developed a live-cell method to measure changes in chromosome numbers. We edited constitutive genes with GFP or RFP tags on single alleles and discovered that cells that lose Chromosome reporters (ChReporters) become non-fluorescent. We applied our new tools to confined mitosis and to inhibition of the putative tumor suppressor myosin-II. We quantified compression of mitotic chromatin in vivo and demonstrated that similar compression in vitro resulted in cell death, but also rare and heritable ChReptorter loss. Myosin-II suppression rescued lethal multipolar divisions and maximized ChReporter loss during three-dimensional (3D) compression and two-dimensional (2D) lateral confinement, but not in standard 2D culture. ChReporter loss was associated with chromosome mis-segregation, rather than just the number of divisions, and loss in vitro and in mice was selected against in subsequent 2D cultures. Inhibition of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) caused ChReporter loss in 2D culture, as expected, but not during 3D compression, suggesting a SAC perturbation. Thus, ChReporters enable diverse studies of viable genetic changes, and show that confinement and myosin-II affect DNA sequence and mechano-evolution.",Pending Annotation,,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,Pending Annotation,,,37288769
