Studies of cellular responses to biomimetic soft materials have been largely restricted to hydrogels and elastomers that have stiffness values independent of time and extent of deformation, so the substrate stiffness can be unambiguously related to its effect on cells. Real tissues, however, often have loss moduli that are 10 to 20% of their elastic moduli and behave as viscoelastic solids. The response of cells to a time-dependent viscous loss is largely uncharacterized because appropriate viscoelastic materials are lacking for quantitative studies. Here we report the synthesis of soft viscoelastic solids in which the elastic and viscous moduli can be independently tuned to produce gels with viscoelastic properties that closely resemble those of soft tissues. Systematic alteration of the hydrogel viscosity demonstrates the time dependence of cellular mechanosensing and the influence of viscous dissipation on cell phenotype.","Atomic Force Microscopy, Cell Culture, Spectroscopy, Immunofluorescent Staining Method",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,,,,29386514

Both quantities are low in hematologic ""liquid"" cancers versus solid tumors in data of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) that also shows the fraction of a genome affected by LOH is ~ one-half of that with CNV. Suspension cultures of p53-null THP-1 leukemia-derived cells conform to these trends, despite novel evidence here of genetic heterogeneity and transiently elevated CNV after perturbation. Single-cell DNAseq indeed reveals at least 8 distinct THP-1 aneuploid clones with further intra-clonal variation, suggesting ongoing genetic evolution. Importantly, acute inhibition of the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) produces CNV levels that are typical of high-CNV solid tumors, with subsequent cell death and down-selection to novel CNV. Pan-cancer analyses show p53 inactivation associates with aneuploidy, but leukemias exhibit a weaker trend even though p53 inactivation correlates with poor survival. Overexpression of p53 in THP-1 does not rescue established aneuploidy or LOH but slightly increases cell death under oxidative or confinement stress, and triggers p21, a key p53 target, but without affecting net growth. Our results suggest that factors other than p53 exert stronger pressures against aneuploidy in liquid cancers, and identifying such CNV suppressors could be useful across liquid and solid tumor types.",Pending Annotation,,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,Pending Annotation,,,37256347

To investigate this, we developed a live-cell method to measure changes in chromosome numbers. We edited constitutive genes with GFP or RFP tags on single alleles and discovered that cells that lose Chromosome reporters (ChReporters) become non-fluorescent. We applied our new tools to confined mitosis and to inhibition of the putative tumor suppressor myosin-II. We quantified compression of mitotic chromatin in vivo and demonstrated that similar compression in vitro resulted in cell death, but also rare and heritable ChReptorter loss. Myosin-II suppression rescued lethal multipolar divisions and maximized ChReporter loss during three-dimensional (3D) compression and two-dimensional (2D) lateral confinement, but not in standard 2D culture. ChReporter loss was associated with chromosome mis-segregation, rather than just the number of divisions, and loss in vitro and in mice was selected against in subsequent 2D cultures. Inhibition of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) caused ChReporter loss in 2D culture, as expected, but not during 3D compression, suggesting a SAC perturbation. Thus, ChReporters enable diverse studies of viable genetic changes, and show that confinement and myosin-II affect DNA sequence and mechano-evolution.",Pending Annotation,,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,Pending Annotation,,,37288769
