As primary human keratinocytes switch from the progenitor state towards differentiation, most NUPs are strongly downregulated, with NUP93 being the most downregulated NUP in this process. To determine if this NUP downregulation is accompanied by a reduction in nuclear pore numbers, we leveraged Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy. No significant changes in nuclear pore numbers were detected using three independent NUP antibodies; however, NUP reduction in other subcellular compartments such as the cytoplasm was identified. To investigate how NUP reduction influences keratinocyte differentiation, we knocked down NUP93 in keratinocytes in the progenitor-state culture condition. NUP93 knockdown diminished keratinocytes' clonogenicity and epidermal regenerative capacity, without drastically affecting nuclear pore numbers or permeability. Using transcriptome profiling, we identified that NUP93 knockdown induces differentiation genes related to both mechanical and immune barrier functions, including the activation of known NF-Œ∫B target genes. Consistently, keratinocytes with NUP93 knockdown exhibited increased nuclear localization of the NF-Œ∫B p65/p50 transcription factors, and increased NF-Œ∫B reporter activity. Taken together, these findings highlight the gene regulatory roles contributed by differential NUP expression levels in keratinocyte differentiation, independent of nuclear pore numbers.","Cell Culture, Plasmid Construction, Western Blotting, RT-qPCR, Imaging, Confocal Microscopy, RNA Sequencing, Apoptosis Assay, Luciferase Reporter Assay",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,GSE209655,Open Access,,,,37853046

Here we show how changes in the nuclear and cellular morphologies of human mesenchymal stromal cells induced by micropillar patterns via contact guidance influence the conformation of the cells' chromatin and their osteogenic differentiation in vitro and in vivo. The micropillars impacted nuclear architecture, lamin A/C multimerization and 3D chromatin conformation, and the ensuing transcriptional reprogramming enhanced the cells' responsiveness to osteogenic differentiation factors and decreased their plasticity and off-target differentiation. In mice with critical-size cranial defects, implants with micropillar patterns inducing nuclear constriction altered the cells' chromatin conformation and enhanced bone regeneration without the need for exogenous signalling molecules. Our findings suggest that medical device topographies could be designed to facilitate bone regeneration via chromatin reprogramming.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Restricted Access,,,,37308586
