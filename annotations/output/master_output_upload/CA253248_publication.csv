Here, we develop a translational approach for exploiting this ""lymphangiogenic potentiation"" of immunotherapy in a cancer vaccine using lethally irradiated tumor cells overexpressing vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) and topical adjuvants. Our ""VEGFC vax"" induced extensive local lymphangiogenesis and promoted stronger T cell activation in both the intradermal vaccine site and draining lymph nodes, resulting in higher frequencies of antigen-specific T cells present systemically than control vaccines. In mouse melanoma models, VEGFC vax elicited potent tumor-specific T cell immunity and provided effective tumor control and long-term immunological memory. Together, these data introduce the potential of lymphangiogenesis induction as a novel immunotherapeutic strategy to consider in cancer vaccine design.","Flow Cytometry, Immunohistochemistry Staining Method, RT-qPCR",Melanoma,Skin ,Not Applicable,Open Access,,,,33762337
