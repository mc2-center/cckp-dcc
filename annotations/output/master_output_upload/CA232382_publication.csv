Based on the modus operandi established in the early days of chemotherapies, most drugs are administered according to predetermined schedules that seek to deliver the maximum tolerated dose and are only adjusted for toxicity. However, we believe that the complex, evolving nature of cancer requires a more dynamic and personalized approach. Chronicling the milestones of the field, we show that the impact of schedule choice crucially depends on processes driving treatment response and failure. As such, cancer heterogeneity and evolution dictate that a one-size-fits-all solution is unlikely-instead, each patient should be mapped to the strategy that best matches their current disease characteristics and treatment objectives (i.e. their 'tumorscape'). To achieve this level of personalization, we need mathematical modeling. In this perspective, we propose a five-step 'Adaptive Dosing Adjusted for Personalized Tumorscapes (ADAPT)' paradigm to integrate data and understanding across scales and derive dynamic and personalized schedules. We conclude with promising examples of model-guided schedule personalization and a call to action to address key outstanding challenges surrounding data collection, model development, and integration.",Mathematical Modeling,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,,,,37777307

An alternative approach is to register collections of whole slide images (WSI), generating spatially aligned datasets. WSI registration is a two-part problem, the first being the alignment itself and the second the application of transformations to huge multi-gigapixel images. To address both challenges, we developed Virtual Alignment of pathoLogy Image Series (VALIS), software which enables generation of highly multiplexed images by aligning any number of brightfield and/or immunofluorescent WSI, the results of which can be saved in the ome.tiff format. Benchmarking using publicly available datasets indicates VALIS provides state-of-the-art accuracy in WSI registration and 3D reconstruction. Leveraging existing open-source software tools, VALIS is written in Python, providing a free, fast, scalable, robust, and easy-to-use pipeline for registering multi-gigapixel WSI, facilitating downstream spatial analyses.",Computational Tool,,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,Colorectal Carcinoma,,https://github.com/MathOnco/VALIS,37495577
