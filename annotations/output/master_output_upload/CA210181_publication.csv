Predicting those volumetric changes would enable new strategies for liver function preservation during treatment planning. However, understanding of the spatial dose/volume relationship is still limited. This study leverages the use of deep learning-based segmentation and biomechanical deformable image registration (DIR) to analyze and predict this relationship. Pre- and Post-EBRT imaging data were collected for 100 patients treated for hepatocellular carcinomas, cholangiocarcinoma or CRC with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with prescription doses ranging from 50 to 100 Gy delivered in 10-28 fractions. For each patient, DIR between the portal and venous (PV) phase of a diagnostic computed tomography (CT) scan acquired before radiation therapy (RT) planning, and a PV phase of a diagnostic CT scan acquired after the end of RT (on average 147 ¬± 36 d) was performed to calculate Jacobian maps representing volume changes in the liver. These volume change maps were used: (i): to analyze the dose/volume relationship in the whole liver and individual Couinaud's segments; and (ii): to investigate the use of deep-learning to predict a Jacobian map solely based on the pre-RT diagnostic CT and planned dose distribution. Moderate correlations between mean equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2) and volume change was observed for all liver sub-regions analyzed individually with Pearson correlation<i>r</i>ranging from -0.36 to -067. The predicted volume change maps showed a significantly stronger voxel-wise correlation with the DIR-based volume change maps than when considering the original EQD2 distribution (0.63 ¬± 0.24 versus 0.55 ¬± 23, respectively), demonstrating the ability of the proposed approach to establish complex relationships between planned dose and liver volume response months after treatment, which represents a promising prediction tool for the development of future adaptive and personalized liver radiation therapy strategies.","Computed Tomography, Deep Learning",Hepatocellular Carcinoma,Liver,Not Applicable,Open Access,,,,37714187

The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors has resulted in impressive and durable clinical responses in the treatment of various cancers. Additionally, immunotherapy utilizing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cells has produced robust responses in blood cancers, and T cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cells are showing promising results in the treatment of solid cancers. Despite these noteworthy advancements in cancer immunotherapy, numerous challenges remain. Some patient populations are unresponsive to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, and CAR T cell therapy has yet to show efficacy against solid cancers. In this review, we first discuss the significant role that T cells play in the body's defense against cancer. We then delve into the mechanisms behind the current challenges facing immunotherapy, starting with T cell exhaustion due to immune checkpoint upregulation and changes in the transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes of dysfunctional T cells. We then discuss cancer-cell-intrinsic characteristics, including molecular alterations in cancer cells and the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment (TME), which collectively facilitate tumor cell proliferation, survival, metastasis, and immune evasion. Finally, we examine recent advancements in cancer immunotherapy, with a specific emphasis on T-cell-based treatments.",Immunotherapy,,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,Pan-cancer,,,37239368
