Here, we used a systems biology approach to compare metabolic fluxes used by parental breast cancer cells and their brain- and lung-homing derivatives. Divergent lineages had distinct, heritable metabolic fluxes. Lung-homing cells maintained high glycolytic flux despite low levels of glycolytic intermediates, constitutively activating a pathway sink into lactate. This strong Warburg effect was associated with a high ratio of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) expression, which correlated with lung metastasis in patients with breast cancer. Although feature classification models trained on clinical characteristics alone were unable to predict tropism, the LDH/PDH ratio was a significant predictor of metastasis to the lung but not to other organs, independent of other transcriptomic signatures. High lactate efflux was also a trait in lung-homing metastatic pancreatic cancer cells, suggesting that lactate production may be a convergent phenotype in lung metastasis. Together, these analyses highlight the essential role that metabolism plays in organ-specific cancer metastasis and identify a putative biomarker for predicting lung metastasis in patients with breast cancer. Significance: Lung-homing metastatic breast cancer cells express an elevated ratio of lactate dehydrogenase to pyruvate dehydrogenase, indicating that ratios of specific metabolic gene transcripts have potential as metabolic biomarkers for predicting organ-specific metastasis.","Cell Culture, ELISA, Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry",Breast Neoplasm,Not Applicable,Not Appicable,Open Access,,,,37526524

To investigate the origins and impact of such plasticity, we performed single-cell analyses on normal, inflamed, premalignant, and malignant tissues in autochthonous models of pancreatic cancer. We reproducibly identified heterogeneous cell states that are primed for diverse, late-emerging neoplastic fates and linked these to chromatin remodeling at cell-cell communication loci. Using an inference approach, we revealed signaling gene modules and tissue-level cross-talk, including a neoplasia-driving feedback loop between discrete epithelial and immune cell populations that was functionally validated in mice. Our results uncover a neoplasia-specific tissue-remodeling program that may be exploited for pancreatic cancer interception.","Single Cell ATAC-Seq, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing, Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method, Immunohistochemistry Staining Method, smFISH",,Not Applicable,GSE207943,Open Access,Pancreatic Neoplasm,,,37167403

RNA velocity methods for tracking phenotypic dynamics ignore information on the regulatory drivers of gene expression variability through time. Results: We introduce scKINETICS (Key regulatory Interaction NETwork for Inferring Cell Speed), a dynamical model of gene expression change which is fit with the simultaneous learning of per-cell transcriptional velocities and a governing gene regulatory network. Fitting is accomplished through an expectation-maximization approach designed to learn the impact of each regulator on its target genes, leveraging biologically motivated priors from epigenetic data, gene-gene coexpression, and constraints on cells' future states imposed by the phenotypic manifold. Applying this approach to an acute pancreatitis dataset recapitulates a well-studied axis of acinar-to-ductal transdifferentiation whilst proposing novel regulators of this process, including factors with previously appreciated roles in driving pancreatic tumorigenesis. In benchmarking experiments, we show that scKINETICS successfully extends and improves existing velocity approaches to generate interpretable, mechanistic models of gene regulatory dynamics.
