Approximately one-tenth of all patients with advanced breast cancer develop brain metastases resulting in an overall survival rate of fewer than 2 years. The challenges lie in developing new approaches to treat, monitor, and prevent breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM). This review will provide an overview of BCBM from the integrated perspective of clinicians, researchers, and patient advocates. We will summarize the current management of BCBM, including diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring. We will highlight ongoing translational research for BCBM, including clinical trials and improved detection methods that can become the mainstay for BCBM treatment if they demonstrate efficacy. We will discuss preclinical BCBM research that focuses on the intrinsic properties of breast cancer cells and the influence of the brain microenvironment. Finally, we will spotlight emerging studies and future research needs to improve survival outcomes and preserve the quality of life for patients with BCBM.","Immunotherapy, Clinical Trial, Imaging","Breast Neoplasm, Brain Neoplasm",Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,,,,34521857

At the tumor migration front, cancer cell clusters are surrounded by an aligned stromal topography. It remains unknown whether aligned stromal topography regulates the resistance of migrating cancer cell clusters to therapeutics. Using a hybrid nanopatterned model to characterize breast cancer cell clusters at the migration front with aligned stromal topography, we demonstrate that topography-induced migrating cancer cell clusters exhibit upregulated cytochrome P450 family 1 (CYP1) drug metabolism and downregulated glycolysis gene signatures, which correlates with unfavorable prognosis. Screening on approved oncology drugs shows that cancer cell clusters on aligned stromal topography are more resistant to diverse chemotherapeutics. Full-dose drug testings further indicate that topography induces drug resistance of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer cell clusters to doxorubicin and tamoxifen and triple-negative breast cancer cell clusters to doxorubicin by activating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)/CYP1 pathways. Inhibiting the AhR/CYP1 pathway restores reactive oxygen species-mediated drug sensitivity to migrating cancer cell clusters, suggesting a plausible therapeutic direction for preventing metastatic recurrence.",Pending Annotation,,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,Pending Annotation,,,37121102
