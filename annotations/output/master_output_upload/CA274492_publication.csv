CRTs require fitting a large number of predictive models, which is often computationally intractable. Existing solutions to reduce the cost of CRTs typically split the dataset into a train and test portion, or rely on heuristics for interactions, both of which lead to a loss in power. We propose the decoupled independence test (DIET), an algorithm that avoids both of these issues by leveraging marginal independence statistics to test conditional independence relationships. DIET tests the marginal independence of two random variables: Fx∣z(x∣z) and Fy∣z(y∣z) where F⋅∣z(⋅∣z) is a conditional cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the distribution p(⋅∣z). These variables are termed ""information residuals."" We give sufficient conditions for DIET to achieve finite sample type-1 error control and power greater than the type-1 error rate. We then prove that when using the mutual information between the information residuals as a test statistic, DIET yields the most powerful conditionally valid test. Finally, we show DIET achieves higher power than other tractable CRTs on several synthetic and real benchmarks.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,,,,37681192

To investigate the origins and impact of such plasticity, we performed single-cell analyses on normal, inflamed, premalignant, and malignant tissues in autochthonous models of pancreatic cancer. We reproducibly identified heterogeneous cell states that are primed for diverse, late-emerging neoplastic fates and linked these to chromatin remodeling at cell-cell communication loci. Using an inference approach, we revealed signaling gene modules and tissue-level cross-talk, including a neoplasia-driving feedback loop between discrete epithelial and immune cell populations that was functionally validated in mice. Our results uncover a neoplasia-specific tissue-remodeling program that may be exploited for pancreatic cancer interception.","Single Cell ATAC-Seq, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing, Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method, Immunohistochemistry Staining Method, smFISH",,Not Applicable,GSE207943,Open Access,Pancreatic Neoplasm,,,37167403

Spatial transcriptomics holds the potential to quantify such variation, but existing analysis methods are limited by their focus on individual tasks such as spot deconvolution. We present BayesTME, an end-to-end Bayesian method for analyzing spatial transcriptomics data. BayesTME unifies several previously distinct analysis goals under a single, holistic generative model. This unified approach enables BayesTME to deconvolve spots into cell phenotypes without any need for paired single-cell RNA-seq. BayesTME then goes beyond spot deconvolution to uncover spatial expression patterns among coordinated subsets of genes within phenotypes, which we term spatial transcriptional programs. BayesTME achieves state-of-the-art performance across myriad benchmarks. On human and zebrafish melanoma tissues, BayesTME identifies spatial transcriptional programs that capture fundamental biological phenomena such as bilateral symmetry and tumor-associated fibroblast and macrophage reprogramming. BayesTME is open source.","Computational Modeling, Mathematical Modeling",,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,Pan-cancer,,,37473731
