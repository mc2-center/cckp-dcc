This approach studies carcinoma and immune cell dynamics in complex tumor microenvironments (TME) with nonlinear optical imaging platforms. Using a tumor-bearing mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), we detail steps to isolate, activate, and label CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes and later introduce them to live murine PDA tumor slice explants. The techniques described in this protocol can improve our understanding of cell migration in complex microenvironments ex¬†vivo.

However, FLIM of NAD(P)H has not been performed in a light-sheet geometry, which is advantageous for rapid imaging of cells within live 3D samples. Aim: We aim to design, validate, and demonstrate a proof-of-concept light-sheet system for NAD(P)H FLIM. Approach: A single-photon avalanche diode camera was integrated into a light-sheet microscope to achieve optical sectioning and limit out-of-focus contributions for NAD(P)H FLIM of single cells. Results: An NAD(P)H light-sheet FLIM system was built and validated with fluorescence lifetime standards and with time-course imaging of metabolic perturbations in pancreas cancer cells with 10 s integration times. NAD(P)H light-sheet FLIM <i>in vivo</i> was demonstrated with live neutrophil imaging in a larval zebrafish tail wound also with 10 s integration times. Finally, the theoretical and practical imaging speeds for NAD(P)H FLIM were compared across laser scanning and light-sheet geometries, indicating a 30× to 6× acquisition speed advantage for the light sheet compared to the laser scanning geometry. Conclusions: FLIM of NAD(P)H is feasible in a light-sheet geometry and is attractive for 3D live cell imaging applications, such as monitoring immune cell metabolism and migration within an organism.",Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy,,Pancreas,Not Applicable,Open Access,Pancreatic Carcinoma,,,37351197

We demonstrate that RAD-TGTs recapitulate prior DNA tension probe studies while also yielding a gain of fluorescence in the force-generating cell that is detectable by flow cytometry. Furthermore, the rupture propensity is altered following disruption of the cytoskeleton using drugs or CRISPR-knockout of mechanosensing proteins. Importantly, RAD-TGTs can differentiate distinct mechanotypes among mixed populations of cells. We also establish oligo rupture and delivery can be measured via DNA sequencing. RAD-TGTs provide a facile and powerful assay to enable high-throughput mechanotype profiling, which could find various applications, for example, in combination with CRISPR screens and -omics analysis.","CRISPR, Flow Cytometry, Next Generation Sequencing, Fluorescence Microscopy",,Not Applicable,PRJNA956930,Open Access,Pan-cancer,,,37117218

However, the chemically complex and spatially heterogeneous composition of tissue specimens and the inherently weak interaction of infrared light with biomolecules limit the analytical performance of infrared absorption spectroscopy. Here, an advanced mid-infrared spectrochemical tissue imaging modality is introduced using metasurfaces that support strong surface-localized electromagnetic fields to capture quantitative molecular maps of large-area murine brain tissue sections. The approach leverages polarization-multiplexed multi-resonance plasmonic metasurfaces to simultaneously detect various functional biomolecules. The surface-enhanced mid-infrared spectral imaging method eliminates the non-specific effects of bulk tissue morphology on quantitative spectral analysis and improves chemical selectivity. This study shows that metasurface enhancement increases the retrieval of amide I and II bands associated with protein secondary structures. Moreover, it is demonstrated that plasmonic metasurfaces enhance the chemical contrast in infrared images and enable detection of ultrathin tissue regions that are not otherwise visible to conventional mid-infrared spectral imaging. While this work uses murine brain tissue sections, the chemical imaging method is well-suited for other tissue types, which broadens its potential impact for translational research and clinical histopathology.","Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, Microscopy
