Although recent large-scale transcriptomic studies have demonstrated that heterogeneous gene expressions play an essential role in determining molecular phenotypes of PDA, biological cues for and consequences of distinct transcriptional programs remain unclear. Methods: We developed an experimental model that enforces the transition of PDA cells toward a basal-like subtype. We combined epigenome and transcriptome analyses with extensive in vitro and in vivo evaluations of tumorigenicity to demonstrate the validity of basal-like subtype differentiation in association with endothelial-like enhancer landscapes via TEA domain transcription factor 2 (TEAD2). Finally, we used loss-of-function experiments to investigate the importance of TEAD2 in regulating reprogrammed enhancer landscape and metastasis in basal-like PDA cells. Results: Aggressive characteristics of the basal-like subtype are faithfully recapitulated in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating the physiological relevance of our model. Further, we showed that basal-like subtype PDA cells acquire a TEAD2-dependent proangiogenic enhancer landscape. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibitions of TEAD2 in basal-like subtype PDA cells impair their proangiogenic phenotypes in vitro and cancer progression in vivo. Last, we identify CD109 as a critical TEAD2 downstream mediator that maintains constitutively activated JAK-STAT signaling in basal-like PDA cells and tumors. Conclusions: Our findings implicate a TEAD2-CD109-JAK/STAT axis in the basal-like differentiated pancreatic cancer cells and as a potential therapeutic vulnerability.","Cell Culture, Plasmid Construction, RT-PCR, ChIP-Seq, ATAC-Seq, RNA Sequencing",,Pancreas,GSE202534,Open Access,Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma,,,36907523
