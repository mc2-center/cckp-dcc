An ongoing challenge is to determine the proteins orchestrating DDR and their organization into complexes, including constitutive interactions and those responding to genomic insult. Here, we use multi-conditional network analysis to systematically map DDR assemblies at multiple scales. Affinity purifications of 21 DDR proteins, with/without genotoxin exposure, are combined with multi-omics data to reveal a hierarchical organization of 605 proteins into 109 assemblies. The map captures canonical repair mechanisms and proposes new DDR-associated proteins extending to stress, transport, and chromatin functions. We find that protein assemblies closely align with genetic dependencies in processing specific genotoxins and that proteins in multiple assemblies typically act in multiple genotoxin responses. Follow-up by DDR functional readouts newly implicates 12 assembly members in double-strand-break repair. The DNA damage response assemblies map is available for interactive visualization and query (ccmi.org/ddram/).","Mass Spectrometry, Proteomics Assay",,Not Applicable,"PXD028064, PXD037494",Open Access,Pan-cancer,,,37220749

To investigate subtype-specific differences in the clinical significance and biology of ctDNA shedding, we perform serial personalized ctDNA analysis in hormone receptor (HR)-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in the I-SPY2 trial. ctDNA positivity rates before, during, and after NAC are higher in TNBC than in HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer patients. Early clearance of ctDNA 3Â weeks after treatment initiation predicts a favorable response to NAC in TNBC only. Whereas ctDNA positivity associates with reduced distant recurrence-free survival in both subtypes. Conversely, ctDNA negativity after NAC correlates with improved outcomes, even in patients with extensive residual cancer. Pretreatment tumor mRNA profiling reveals associations between ctDNA shedding and cell cycle and immune-associated signaling. On the basis of these findings, the I-SPY2 trial will prospectively test ctDNA for utility in redirecting therapy to improve response and prognosis.",Cell-free Circulating Tumor DNA Assay,,Breast,GSE194040,Open Access,Breast Carcinoma,,,37146605
