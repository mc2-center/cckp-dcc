Previous models have elucidated interactions between EGFR and downstream adaptor proteins or showed phenotypes affected by EGFR. However, the link between specific EGFR phosphorylation sites and phenotypic outcomes is still poorly understood. Here, we employed a suite of isogenic cell lines expressing site-specific mutations at each of the EGFR C-terminal phosphorylation sites to interrogate their role in the signaling network and cell biological response to stimulation. Our results demonstrate the resilience of the EGFR network, which was largely similar even in the context of multiple Y-to-F mutations in the EGFR C-terminal tail, while also revealing nodes in the network that have not previously been linked to EGFR signaling. Our data-driven model highlights the signaling network nodes associated with distinct EGF-driven cell responses, including migration, proliferation, and receptor trafficking. Application of this same approach to less-studied RTKs should provide a plethora of novel associations that should lead to an improved understanding of these signaling networks.","Plasmid Construction, Flow Cytometry, Cell Culture, Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry, Cell Proliferation Assay, Migration Assay",,Not Applicable,PXD032403,Open Access,Pan-cancer,,,37169593
