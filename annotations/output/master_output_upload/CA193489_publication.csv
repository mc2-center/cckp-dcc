Recent experimental evidence suggests that post-therapy PACC-derived recurrent populations display cross-resistance to classes of therapies with independent mechanisms of action. We hypothesize that this can occur through PACC memory, whereby cancer cells that have undergone a polyaneuploid transition (PAT) reenter the PACC state more quickly or have higher levels of innate resistance. In this paper, we build on our prior mathematical models of the eco-evolutionary dynamics of cells in the 2N+ and PACC states to investigate these two hypotheses. We show that although an increase in innate resistance is more effective at promoting cross-resistance, this trend can also be produced via PACC memory. We also find that resensitization of cells that acquire increased innate resistance through the PAT have a considerable impact on eco-evolutionary dynamics and extinction probabilities. This study, though theoretical in nature, can help inspire future experimentation to tease apart hypotheses surrounding how cross-resistance in structured cancer populations arises.",Mathematical Modeling,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,,,,37700000

An alternative approach is to register collections of whole slide images (WSI), generating spatially aligned datasets. WSI registration is a two-part problem, the first being the alignment itself and the second the application of transformations to huge multi-gigapixel images. To address both challenges, we developed Virtual Alignment of pathoLogy Image Series (VALIS), software which enables generation of highly multiplexed images by aligning any number of brightfield and/or immunofluorescent WSI, the results of which can be saved in the ome.tiff format. Benchmarking using publicly available datasets indicates VALIS provides state-of-the-art accuracy in WSI registration and 3D reconstruction. Leveraging existing open-source software tools, VALIS is written in Python, providing a free, fast, scalable, robust, and easy-to-use pipeline for registering multi-gigapixel WSI, facilitating downstream spatial analyses.",Computational Tool,,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,Colorectal Carcinoma,,https://github.com/MathOnco/VALIS,37495577
