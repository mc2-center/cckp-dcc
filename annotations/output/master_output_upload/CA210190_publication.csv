This approach studies carcinoma and immune cell dynamics in complex tumor microenvironments (TME) with nonlinear optical imaging platforms. Using a tumor-bearing mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), we detail steps to isolate, activate, and label CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes and later introduce them to live murine PDA tumor slice explants. The techniques described in this protocol can improve our understanding of cell migration in complex microenvironments ex¬†vivo. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Tabdanov et¬†al.

We present here ""Rupture And Deliver"" Tension Gauge Tethers (RAD-TGTs) in which flow cytometry is used to record the mechanical history of thousands of cells exerting forces on their surroundings via their propensity to rupture immobilized DNA duplex tension probes. We demonstrate that RAD-TGTs recapitulate prior DNA tension probe studies while also yielding a gain of fluorescence in the force-generating cell that is detectable by flow cytometry. Furthermore, the rupture propensity is altered following disruption of the cytoskeleton using drugs or CRISPR-knockout of mechanosensing proteins. Importantly, RAD-TGTs can differentiate distinct mechanotypes among mixed populations of cells. We also establish oligo rupture and delivery can be measured via DNA sequencing. RAD-TGTs provide a facile and powerful assay to enable high-throughput mechanotype profiling, which could find various applications, for example, in combination with CRISPR screens and -omics analysis.","CRISPR, Flow Cytometry, Next Generation Sequencing, Fluorescence Microscopy",,Not Applicable,PRJNA956930,Open Access,Pan-cancer,,,37117218
