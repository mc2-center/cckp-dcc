While mapping these relationships between TFs is important for understanding their context-specific functions, existing approaches either rely on DNA binding motif predictions, interrogate one TF at a time, or study individual TFs in parallel. Here, we introduce paired yeast one-hybrid (pY1H) assays to detect cooperativity and antagonism across hundreds of TF-pairs at DNA regions of interest. We provide evidence that a wide variety of TFs are subject to modulation by other TFs in a DNA region-specific manner. We also demonstrate that TF-TF relationships are often affected by alternative isoform usage and identify cooperativity and antagonism between human TFs and viral proteins from human papillomaviruses, Epstein-Barr virus, and other viruses. Altogether, pY1H assays provide a broadly applicable framework to study how different functional relationships affect protein occupancy at regulatory DNA regions.","DNA Sequencing, ChIP-Seq",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,PRJNA1015222,Open Access,,,,37853017
