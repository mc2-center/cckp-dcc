One factor known to contribute to the poor chemotherapy response is the poor drug diffusion into PDAC tumors. Novel treatment methods are therefore drastically needed to improve targeted delivery of treatments. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of the 3DNA¬Æ Nanocarrier (3DNA) platform to direct delivery of therapeutics to PDAC tumors in vivo. Materials and methods: A panel of PDAC cell lines and a patient tissue microarray were screened for established tumor-specific proteins to identify targeting moieties for active targeting of the 3DNA. NRG mice with or without orthotopic MIA PaCa-2-luciferase PDAC tumors were treated intraperitoneally with 100 Œºl of fluorescently labeled 3DNA. Results: Folic acid and transferrin receptors were significantly elevated in PDAC compared to normal pancreas. Accordingly, both folic acid- and transferrin-conjugated 3DNA treatments significantly increased delivery of 3DNA specifically to tumors in comparison to unconjugated 3DNA treatment. In the absence of tumors, there was an increased clearance of both folic acid-conjugated 3DNA and unconjugated 3DNA, compared to the clearance rate in tumor-bearing mice. Lastly, delivery of siLuciferase by folic acid-conjugated 3DNA in an orthotopic model of luciferase-expressing PDAC showed significant and prolonged suppression of luciferase protein expression and activity. Conclusion: Our study progresses the 3DNA technology as a reliable and effective treatment delivery platform for targeted therapeutic approaches in PDAC.","Luciferase Reporter Assay, qPCR, Immunohistochemistry Staining Method",Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,,,,37004490

Mouse models of TNBC are important for development of new therapies, however, few mouse models represent the complexity of TNBC. Here, we develop a female TNBC murine model by mimicking two common TNBC mutations with high co-occurrence: amplification of the oncogene MYC and deletion of the tumor suppressor PTEN. This Myc;Ptenfl model develops heterogeneous triple-negative mammary tumors that display histological and molecular features commonly found in human TNBC. Our research involves deep molecular and spatial analyses on Myc;Ptenfl tumors including bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing, and multiplex tissue-imaging. Through comparison with human TNBC, we demonstrate that this genetic mouse model develops mammary tumors with differential survival and therapeutic responses that closely resemble the inter- and intra-tumoral and microenvironmental heterogeneity of human TNBC, providing a pre-clinical tool for assessing the spectrum of patient TNBC biology and drug response.","Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method, RNA Sequencing, Cyclic Immunofluorescence, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing",Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma,Breast,"GSE215071,  GSE215070,  GSE176078",Open Access,,,,37704631

Effective alternative therapies have yet to emerge, as chemotherapy remains the best available systemic treatment. However, the discovery of safe and available adjuncts to enhance chemotherapeutic efficacy can still improve survival outcomes. We show that a hyperglycemic state substantially enhances the efficacy of conventional single- and multi-agent chemotherapy regimens against PDAC. Molecular analyses of tumors exposed to high glucose levels reveal that the expression of GCLC (glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit), a key component of glutathione biosynthesis, is diminished, which in turn augments oxidative anti-tumor damage by chemotherapy. Inhibition of GCLC phenocopies the suppressive effect of forced hyperglycemia in mouse models of PDAC, while rescuing this pathway mitigates anti-tumor effects observed with chemotherapy and high glucose.","Cell Culture, CRISPR, RT-qPCR, RNA Sequencing, Immunohistochemistry Staining Method",,Pancreas,GSE194369,Open Access,Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma,,,37380658

Here, we exploit the concept of ""trajectory embedding"" to analyze cellular behavior using morphological feature trajectory histories-that is, multiple time points simultaneously, rather than the more common practice of examining morphological feature time courses in single timepoint (snapshot) morphological features. We apply this approach to analyze live-cell images of MCF10A mammary epithelial cells after treatment with a panel of microenvironmental perturbagens that strongly modulate cell motility, morphology, and cell cycle behavior. Our morphodynamical trajectory embedding analysis constructs a shared cell state landscape revealing ligand-specific regulation of cell state transitions and enables quantitative and descriptive models of single-cell trajectories. Additionally, we show that incorporation of trajectories into single-cell morphological analysis enables (i) systematic characterization of cell state trajectories, (ii) better separation of phenotypes, and (iii) more descriptive models of ligand-induced differences as compared to snapshot-based analysis.
