Although circulating adaptive and innate lymphocyte effector responses are required for effective antimetastatic immunity, whether tissue-resident immune circuits confer initial immunity at sites of metastatic dissemination remains ill defined. Here we examine the nature of local immune cell responses during early metastatic seeding in the lung using intracardiac injection to mimic monodispersed metastatic spread. Using syngeneic murine melanoma and colon cancer models, we demonstrate that lung-resident conventional type 2 dendritic cells (DC2) orchestrate a local immune circuit to confer host antimetastatic immunity. Tissue-specific ablation of lung DC2, and not peripheral DC populations, led to increased metastatic burden in the presence of an intact T cell and NK cell compartment. We demonstrate that DC nucleic acid sensing and transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7 signaling are required for early metastatic control and that DC2 serve as a robust source of proinflammatory cytokines in the lung. Critically, DC2 direct the local production of IFN-Œ≥ by lung-resident NK cells, which limits the initial metastatic burden. Collectively, our results highlight, to our knowledge, a novel DC2-NK cell axis that colocalizes around pioneering metastatic cells to orchestrate an early innate immune response program to limit initial metastatic burden in the lung.","Microscopy, Flow Cytometry",Melanoma,Skin,Not Applicable,Open Access,,,,36881866
