Drp1 deletion inhibits tumorigenesis of KRas-driven pancreatic cancer, but the role of mitochondrial dynamics in other Ras-driven malignancies is poorly defined. Here we show that in vitro and in vivo growth of KRas-driven lung adenocarcinoma is unaffected by deletion of Drp1 but is inhibited by deletion of Opa1, the GTPase that regulates inner membrane fusion and proper cristae morphology. Mechanistically, Opa1 knockout disrupts cristae morphology and inhibits electron transport chain (ETC) assembly and activity, which inhibits tumor cell proliferation through loss of NAD<sup>+</sup> regeneration. Simultaneous inactivation of Drp1 and Opa1 restores cristae morphology, ETC activity, and cell proliferation indicating that mitochondrial fission activity drives ETC dysfunction induced by Opa1 knockout. Our results support a model in which mitochondrial fission events disrupt cristae structure, and tumor cells with hyperactive fission activity require Opa1 activity to maintain ETC function.","CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay, Transmission Electron Microscopy, Flow Cytometry, Plasmid Construction, Viral Transduction",,Lung,Not Applicable,Open Access,Lung Adenocarcinoma,,,36516772
