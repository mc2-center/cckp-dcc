The explicit number of isomers as a function of size is computed using a graph theoretic approach that is compared to a direct count for smaller systems. This allows us to apply a common approach to both nanosystems and their macroscopic limit. The entropy increases very rapidly with size with the results that replacing the actual distribution over size by an average is not an accurate approximation. That the phase transition is a sharp function of the temperature is due to the high heat capacity of both the solid and liquid phases. The difference in entropy at the transition is related to the Trouton-Richards considerations. The finite width of the boundary between two phases of a finite system is related to the inherent uncertainty product that is derived from the maximum entropy formalism and that is a result of the fluctuations about equilibrium. As the system size increases, the boundary becomes sharper and one recovers the usual thermodynamic description.",Pending Annotation,,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Restricted Access,Pending Annotation,,,37603753

To identify the underlying genetic and transcriptomic landscapes, in this study we analyzed multi-organ metastases and tumor-adjacent tissues from 11 rapid autopsies after treatment with MAPK inhibitor (MAPKi) and/or immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and death due to acquired resistance. Either treatment elicits shared genetic alterations that suggest immune-evasive, cross-therapy resistance mechanisms. Large, non-clustered deletions, inversions and inter-chromosomal translocations dominate rearrangements. Analyzing data from separate melanoma cohorts including 345 therapy-naive patients and 35 patients with patient-matched pre-treatment and post-acquired resistance tumor samples, we performed cross-cohort analyses to identify MAPKi and ICB as respective contributors to gene amplifications and deletions enriched in autopsy versus therapy-naive tumors. In the autopsy cohort, private/late mutations and structural variants display shifted mutational and rearrangement signatures, with MAPKi specifically selecting for signatures of defective homologous-recombination, mismatch and base-excision repair. Transcriptomic signatures and crosstalks with tumor-adjacent macroenvironments nominated organ-specific adaptive pathways. An immune-desert, CD8<sup>+</sup>-macrophage-biased archetype, T-cell exhaustion and type-2 immunity characterized the immune contexture. This multi-organ analysis of therapy-resistant melanoma presents preliminary insights with potential to improve therapeutic strategies.","Patient Derived Xenograft, Whole Exome Sequencing, Whole Genome Sequencing, RNA Sequencing",,Not Applicable,EGAS00001006644,Open Access,Melanoma,,,37106167
