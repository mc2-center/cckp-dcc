Mouse models of TNBC are important for development of new therapies, however, few mouse models represent the complexity of TNBC. Here, we develop a female TNBC murine model by mimicking two common TNBC mutations with high co-occurrence: amplification of the oncogene MYC and deletion of the tumor suppressor PTEN. This Myc;Ptenfl model develops heterogeneous triple-negative mammary tumors that display histological and molecular features commonly found in human TNBC. Our research involves deep molecular and spatial analyses on Myc;Ptenfl tumors including bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing, and multiplex tissue-imaging. Through comparison with human TNBC, we demonstrate that this genetic mouse model develops mammary tumors with differential survival and therapeutic responses that closely resemble the inter- and intra-tumoral and microenvironmental heterogeneity of human TNBC, providing a pre-clinical tool for assessing the spectrum of patient TNBC biology and drug response.","Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method, RNA Sequencing, Cyclic Immunofluorescence, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing",Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma,Breast,"GSE215071,  GSE215070,  GSE176078",Open Access,,,,37704631

However, toxicity and rapid emergence of resistance have limited their clinical implementation. To identify state changes underlying acquisition of resistance to the JQ1 BETi, we reanalyzed single-cell RNAseq data from JQ1 sensitive and resistant SUM149 and SUM159 triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. Parental and JQ1-resistant SUM149 and SUM159 exhibited a stem cell-like and embryonic diapause (SCLED) cell state as well as a transitional cell state between the SCLED state that is present in both treatment na√Øve and JQ1 treated cells, and a number of JQ1 resistant cell states. A transitional cell state transcriptional signature but not a SCLED state transcriptional signature predicted worsened outcomes in basal-like breast cancer patients suggesting that transit from the SCLED state to drug-resistant states contributes to patient outcomes. Entry of SUM149 and SUM159 into the transitional cell state was characterized by elevated expression of the CD9 tetraspanin. Knockdown or inhibition of CD9-sensitized cells to multiple targeted and cytotoxic drugs in vitro. Importantly, CD9 knockdown or blockade sensitized SUM149 to JQ1 in vivo by trapping cells in the SCLED state and limiting transit to resistant cell states. Thus, CD9 appears to be critical for the transition from a SCLED state into treatment-resistant cell states and warrants exploration as a therapeutic target in basal-like breast cancer.","Single Cell ATAC-Seq, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing",,Breast,"GSE131102, GSE157220, GSE123837, GSE162798, GSE154927, GSE150949, GSE118390, GSE221183.",Open Access,"Breast Adenocarcinoma, Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma",,,37542044

Here, we exploit the concept of ""trajectory embedding"" to analyze cellular behavior using morphological feature trajectory histories-that is, multiple time points simultaneously, rather than the more common practice of examining morphological feature time courses in single timepoint (snapshot) morphological features. We apply this approach to analyze live-cell images of MCF10A mammary epithelial cells after treatment with a panel of microenvironmental perturbagens that strongly modulate cell motility, morphology, and cell cycle behavior. Our morphodynamical trajectory embedding analysis constructs a shared cell state landscape revealing ligand-specific regulation of cell state transitions and enables quantitative and descriptive models of single-cell trajectories. Additionally, we show that incorporation of trajectories into single-cell morphological analysis enables (i) systematic characterization of cell state trajectories, (ii) better separation of phenotypes, and (iii) more descriptive models of ligand-induced differences as compared to snapshot-based analysis. This morphodynamical trajectory embedding is broadly applicable to the quantitative analysis of cell responses via live-cell imaging across many biological and biomedical applications.",Imaging,,Breast,Not Applicable,Open Access,Breast Neoplasm,,,37142678
