Recent experimental evidence suggests that post-therapy PACC-derived recurrent populations display cross-resistance to classes of therapies with independent mechanisms of action. We hypothesize that this can occur through PACC memory, whereby cancer cells that have(Read more on Pubmed)",Mathematical Modeling,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,37700000,59e13d7e-eacc-4f35-9c9c-8be1a8e26eb0,syn52499990
