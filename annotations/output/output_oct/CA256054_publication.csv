We engineered liposomes that are conjugated with anti-CD335 antibodies for NK cell targeting, and the apoptotic ligand TRAIL to kill cancer cells. Liposomes were made using a thin film hydration method followed (Read more on Pubmed)","Cell Culture, Scanning Electron Microscopy",Colorectal Neoplasm,"Intestine, Colon",Not Applicable,Open Access,37772330,68f3d3f3-8239-49fd-adbb-af17abdd0be0,syn52566241
