Mouse models of TNBC are important for development of new therapies, however, few mouse models represent the complexity of TNBC. Here, we develop a female TNBC murine model by mimicking two common TNBC mutations with high co-occurrence: amplification of the oncogene MYC and deletion of the tumor suppress(Read more on Pubmed)","Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method, RNA Sequencing, Cyclic Immunofluorescence, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing",Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma,Breast,"GSE215071,  GSE215070,  GSE176078",Open Access,37704631,69b2210b-5cde-46df-b3c7-fdad7d0078ff,syn52500282
