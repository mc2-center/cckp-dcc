Take Precision Medicine of cancer as an example, in which the goal is to match patients with treatments based on molecular markers identified in each patient's tumor. A substantial challenge, however, is that the molecular markers can vary significantly at d(Read more on Pubmed)","Mathematical Modeling, Computational Modeling",Glioblastoma,Brain,Not Applicable,Open Access,37700873,f3095064-a091-47a0-b62d-34b4e0711031,syn52564699
