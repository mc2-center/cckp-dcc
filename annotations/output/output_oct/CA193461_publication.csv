Here, we investigate how populations with non-genetic fitness variation cross fitness valleys, common barriers to adaptation in rugged fitness landscapes in which a population must pa(Read more on Pubmed)",Computational Modeling,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,30272027,5e63d624-234e-48b2-a81a-d476f1acaede,syn52499989

As macrophages efficiently localize to the TME, we hypothesized that they could be used as a delivery vehicle for drugs de(Read more on Pubmed)",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Restricted Access,37296315,40437df7-33a9-426e-ab5a-3aeae50417db,syn52499989
