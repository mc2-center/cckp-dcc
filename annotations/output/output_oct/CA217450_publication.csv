Sample multiplexing where multiple samples are pooled together for single-cell experiments, attracts wide attention due to its benefits of increasing capacity, reducing costs, and minimizing batch effects. To analyze multiplexed data, the first crucial step is to demultiplex, the process of assigning cells to indi(Read more on Pubmed)","Single Cell RNA-Sequencing, Mathematical Modeling, Computational Modeling",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,37664174,0f57a165-2d81-4d61-a10a-043b861cfa28,syn52543482
