These modifications can have an impact on various pathways, including host antiviral immune responses. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of epigenetic modifications induced by viruses to counteract host antiviral immune res(Read more on Pubmed)",Targeted Therapy Agent,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,37656959,ce88a2bb-b2ed-407a-8268-7ba697f3e884,syn52500357
