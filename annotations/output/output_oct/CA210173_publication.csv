Approximately one-tenth of all patients with advanced breast cancer develop brain metastases resulting in an overall survival rate of fewer than 2 years. The challenges lie in developing new approaches to treat, monitor, and prevent breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM). This review will provide an overview of BCBM from the in(Read more on Pubmed)","Immunotherapy, Clinical Study, Imaging","Breast Neoplasm, Brain Neoplasm",Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,34521857,6b084492-aeb3-464f-b5b2-165f067dd157,syn52500342
