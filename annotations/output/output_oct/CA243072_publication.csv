Given the small numbers of patients with relapsed AML and historical logistical barriers to international collaboration including poor trial funding an(Read more on Pubmed)","Immunotherapy, Next Generation Sequencing",Acute Myeloid Leukemia,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,36861399,91e01855-5075-485c-b4fa-aea342de0636,syn52565490

While significant gains have been made to position targeted therapies for B-ALL treatment, continued efforts are needed to develop therapeutic options with improved duration of response. Here, first we have demonstrated that patients with CRLF2-rearranged Ph-like ALL harbor e(Read more on Pubmed)","Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting, Immunotherapy",B Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,37634013,5892261c-79cd-4190-aebc-89d1e1b3697b,syn52565490

Here, we show that the MS4A1 gene encoding human CD20 also produces several mRNA isoforms with distinct 5' untranslated regions (5'-UTR). Four variants (V1-4) were detectable by RNA-seq in distinct stages of normal B-cell differentiation and B-lymphoid malignancies, with V1 and V3 bei(Read more on Pubmed)",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Restricted Access,37683180,cba5db1b-83c0-4841-9b54-1e9e8decdead,syn52565490
