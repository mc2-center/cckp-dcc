Mouse models of TNBC are important for development of new therapies, however, few mouse models represent the complexity of TNBC. Here, we develop a female TNBC murine model by mimicking two common TNBC mutations with high co-occurrence: amplification of the oncogene MYC and deletion of the tumor suppress(Read more on Pubmed)","Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method, RNA Sequencing, Cyclic Immunofluorescence, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing",Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma,Breast,"GSE215071,  GSE215070,  GSE176078",Open Access,37704631,db8c455b-a5c3-475f-a636-8739afbe4cd1,syn52564697

MYC has emerged as a master regulator governing tumor intrinsic and tumor microenvironment interactions, supporting tumor progression and driving drug resistance.
