Studies of cellular responses to biomimetic soft materials have been largely restricted to hydrogels and elastomers that have stiffness values independent of time and extent of deformation, so the substrate stiffness can be unambiguously related to its effect on cells. Real tissues, however, often have loss modu(Read more on Pubmed)","Atomic Force Microscopy, Cell Culture, Spectroscopy, Immunofluorescent Staining Method",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,29386514,cccaa55c-65d3-4bde-9057-84e2a837fd3c,syn52499988
