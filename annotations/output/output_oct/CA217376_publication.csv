A high-quality reference genome is needed to better understand these regenerative properties at the molecular level. Here, we present an improved reference genome for A. cahirinus gene(Read more on Pubmed)","Nanopore Sequencing, RNA Sequencing",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,PRJNA935753,Open Access,37552705,ff621034-c100-4f88-b8ce-626a1a5a14ac,syn52543483
