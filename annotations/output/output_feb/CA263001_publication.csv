Here, we dissect the impact of this genotype on melanoma tumor growth kinetics, tumor phenotype, and response to treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) or targeted therapy.

The identification of cancer-specific SE-driven genes is a powerful means for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies. Here, we identify a MITF/SOX10/TFIIH-dependent SE promoting the expression of BAHCC1 in a broad panel of melanoma cells.
