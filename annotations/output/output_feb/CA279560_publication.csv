While it is well-established that intraluminal lymphatic valves in the collecting LVs prevent fluid backflow (secondary lymphatic valves), a separate valve system in the initial LVs that only permits interstitial fluid influx into the LVs, preventing fluid leakage back to t(Read more on Pubmed)",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,37981867,5c3f6deb-36b6-4c0e-843d-52d543cac20f,syn53693595
