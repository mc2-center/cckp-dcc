However, the complexity of bone marrow cellular, morphologic, and spatial architecture preserved in trephine samples hinders comprehensive evaluation. To dissect the diverse cellular communities and mosaic tissue habitats, we developed a superpixel-inspired deep learning method (MoSaicNet) that adapts to complex tissue a(Read more on Pubmed)",Deep Learning,Multiple Myeloma,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,37963212,0781e833-6ea8-46e3-879c-fde8393d7966,syn52543483

Mutations in common colorectal cancer driver genes are often not consistent with those signatures.
