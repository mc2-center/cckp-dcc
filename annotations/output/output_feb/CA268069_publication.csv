While it is known that forces produced by individual contractile cells can stiffen the matrix, it remains uncle(Read more on Pubmed)",Computational Modeling,Breast Carcinoma,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,38272198,0e1f2019-f4fc-492b-ac7d-291f82eb5b72,syn52566262

Immunosuppression by myeloid cells in both the tumor microenvironment and systemic circulation are believed to contribute to this treatment resistance. Standard multi-modality therapy includes conventionally fractionated radiotherapy over 6 weeks; however, hypofractiona(Read more on Pubmed)",Clinical Study,Glioblastoma,Brain,Not Applicable,Open Access,38022656,1a62df40-ebb1-468e-8c41-9e3b010ad83d,syn52566262

Due to long computation times and the lack of accessible, open-source real-time analysis toolkits, traditional analysis of FLIM data, particularly with the widely used time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) approach, typically occurs after acquisition.
