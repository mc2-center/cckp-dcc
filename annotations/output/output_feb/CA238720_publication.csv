Targeted therapies have limited success in treating TNBC, thus a strategy enabling effective targeted combinations is an unmet need. To tackle these challenges and discover individualized targeted combination therapies for TNBC, we integrated phosphoprot(Read more on Pubmed)","Patient Derived Xenograft, Computational Modeling",Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma       ,Breast,Not Applicable,Open Access,38229082,5950f894-3e72-4f8b-bd53-7ffaaf42bc35,syn52565432

Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) serve to dephosphorylate RTKs and their proximal adaptor proteins, thus serving to modulate RTK activity. While the general function of RPTPs is well understood, the direct and indirect substrates for each RPTP are poorly characterize(Read more on Pubmed)",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,38147214,fb161f3e-980d-450f-af67-6c7072301a8f,syn52565432
