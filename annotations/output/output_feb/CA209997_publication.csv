Disruption of protein expression can suppress targets and enable therapeutic intervention. To this end, we developed a drug discovery workflow that incorporates cell-line-selective screening and high-throughput expression profiling followed by regulatory network analys(Read more on Pubmed)",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,"SRX22049731, SRX22049704, SRX22050109, SRX22050052, SRX22049928, SRX22049687, SRX22050077, SRX22049910, SRX22049926, SRX22050098, SRX22049943, SRX22050038, SRX22050117, SRX22050059, SRX22049776, SRX22050081, SRX22049603, SRX22049918, SRX22050004, SRX22049720, SRX22049711, SRP465509, SRX22049895, SRX22049839, SRX22050073, SRX22049837, SRX22050099, SRX22050110, SRX22050017, SRX22049634, SRX22049660,(Read more on Pubmed)",Restricted Access,,38061356
