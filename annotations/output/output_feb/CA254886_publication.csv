Here we use a live-cell ""ChReporter"" method to identify cells with a single chromosomal loss in efforts to better understand differences in cell shape, motility, and growth. We focus on a standard cancer line and first show clonal populati(Read more on Pubmed)",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,37903225,7700b3ea-2546-45c2-8077-b9881e58909b,syn52566240
