They were initially developed by architects and computer scientists to create a higher level of abstraction for their designs. Here, we extend these concepts to cell biology to lend a new perspective on the evolved designs of cells' underlying reaction networks. We present a catalog of 21 design patterns divided into three(Read more on Pubmed)",Modeling,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,38247191,a2ef86e5-72b1-4db8-b322-61258841a69c,syn52564853
