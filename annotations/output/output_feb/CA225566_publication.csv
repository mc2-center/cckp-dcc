A decrease in lamin levels and/or lamin mutations are associated with a host of human diseases. Despite being only about 15 nm thick, perturbation of components of the nuclear lamina dramatically impacts the deformation response of the entire nucleus through mechanisms that are not well un(Read more on Pubmed)",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,38283102,58bf69cf-67a2-4f38-94b5-5e46c34dd2e0,syn52564852
