This study aimed to gain a better understanding of the immune response behind the success of the vaccine in vivo, through use of ex vivo and in vivo assays. Here, we analyze the activation of various immune cells isolated from healthy (Read more on Pubmed)",Immunotherapy,Breast Neoplasm       ,Breast,Not Applicable,Open Access,38092224,76823919-7c12-4d0f-9405-4fa8cb7bfae4,syn52566241

Reducing treatment costs while enhancing cell activation could help to make immunotherapies more accessible. Cells can be activated by both internal and external forces including fluid shear stress (FSS). FSS activates cells via opening of mechanosensitive ion ch(Read more on Pubmed)","Cell Culture, Flow Cytometry, Confocal Microscopy",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,37729773,1de2f8bb-2918-41bf-8612-22ec81050d37,syn52566241
