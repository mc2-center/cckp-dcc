A challenge for all multiplexing techniques is to link sample-specific barcodes with cell-specific barcodes, then demultiplex sample identity post-sequencing. However, existing demultiplexing tools fail under many real-world conditions where barcode cro(Read more on Pubmed)",Computational Tool,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,38291503,0a188c85-be4b-4cc5-96de-29e1a0729fb0,syn52500003
