Genome-scale modeling is a promising method to understand these interactions and identify strategies to optimize the community. Flux balance analysis (FBA) is most often used to predict the flux through all reactions in a genome-scale model; however, the fluxes predicted by FBA depend on a u(Read more on Pubmed)",Modeling,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,38287239,fcefb96e-6c74-4cab-84ae-9c1aae262fd5,syn52565158
