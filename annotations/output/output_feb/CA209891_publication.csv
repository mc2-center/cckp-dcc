To identify RBPs that directly drive alternative exon inclusion, we developed tethered function luciferase-based splicing reporters that provide rapid, scalable and robust readouts of exon inclusion changes and used these to evaluate 718 human RBPs. We performed enhanced cross-(Read more on Pubmed)","Luciferase Reporter Assay, Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis, Western Blotting, Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry         ",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,GSE232599,Open Access,38168984,db6bc198-25c1-4e87-af18-94a6a7ccd6b6,syn52500084

In melanoma, whether cells in the microenvironment can endow such competence remains unclear. Using a combination of zebrafish transgenesis coupled with human tissues, we demonstrate that GABAergic signaling between keratinocytes and melanocytes promotes melanoma initiation by BRAFV600E.

Here, we perform a high-throughput chemogenetic drug screen in GNAQ-mutant UM contrasted with BRAF-mutant cutaneous melanoma, defining the druggable landscape of these distinct melanoma subtypes.
