Typically, hypoxia is viewed as a negative marker of patients' survival, because of its implication in the development of aggressive tumors and tumor resistance. Several drugs that specifically target the hypoxic cells have been developed, providin(Read more on Pubmed)",Mathematical Modeling,Pancreatic Carcinoma,Pancreas,Not Applicable,Open Access,38182612,eec8d4bb-bd4f-4047-b16c-3371708830b8,syn52500079
