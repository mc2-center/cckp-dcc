We assayed for intra- and interpatient drug response heterogeneity through testing of patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTOs). Methods: PDTOs were generated from CRS/HIPEC patients from December 2021 to September 2022 and subjected to an in vitro (Read more on Pubmed),Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,38175427,7a813e41-3698-4624-81ad-dfd009b59bc6,syn52566267
