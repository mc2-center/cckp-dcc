Although circulating adaptive and innate lymphocyte effector responses are required for effective antimetastatic immunity, whether tissue-resident immune circuits confer initial immunity at sites of metastatic dissemination remains ill defined. Here we examine the nature of local im(Read more on Pubmed)","Microscopy, Flow Cytometry",Melanoma,Skin,Not Applicable,Open Access,36881866

Myeloid cells within the tumor microenvironment can modulate checkpoint resistance by either supporting or suppressing adaptive immune responses. Using an anti-PD-1-resistant mouse melanoma model, we show that targeting the myeloid compartment via CD40 activation and CSF1R blockade (Read more on Pubmed)",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,"GSE230004, SRX20853535, GSE236303, SRX20853536, SRX20003477, SRP433257, SRP446856",Restricted Access,37478171
