Here, we develop a translational approach for exploiting this ""lymphangiogenic potentiation"" of immunotherapy in a cancer vaccine using lethally irradiated tumor cells ov(Read more on Pubmed)","Flow Cytometry, Immunohistochemistry Staining Method, RT-qPCR",Melanoma,Skin ,Not Applicable,Open Access,33762337,f79be13a-18b7-4164-a310-d13154b8c6b9,syn52566227

Nevertheless, the number of cancer vaccines in the clinic remains very limited to date, highlighting the need for further technology development. Recently, cancer vaccines have been improved by the use of materials, which can strongly enhance their intrinsic properties an(Read more on Pubmed)","Targeted Therapy Agent, Immunotherapy",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,32117911,cbae7adc-31b9-42e5-a97a-2bd5ad6dcca4,syn52566227
