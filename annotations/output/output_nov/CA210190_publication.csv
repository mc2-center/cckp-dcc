This approach studies carcinoma and immune cell dynamics in complex tumor microenvironments (TME) with nonlinear optical imaging platforms. Using a tumor-bearing mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), we detail steps to isolate, activate, and label CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes and later introduce them (Read more on Pubmed)","Imaging, Time Lapse Microscopy",Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma,Pancreas,Not Appicable,Open Access,36861840,744c431f-00b6-4c89-b68c-5d54beb7cffc,syn52500358

The mechanisms underlying its cellular roles remain elusive. Interestingly, unusual coupling between the nucleotide- and microtubule-binding sites of this kinesin-6 has been reported, but little is known about how its divergent sequence leads to atypical motility properties. We present here the first high-resol(Read more on Pubmed)","X-Ray Crystallography, Cryo-Electron Microscopy",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,"PDB: 8BJS, PDB: 8F1A, PDB: 8F18 ",Open Access,37726093,29e0d53c-55b3-441e-bf24-31036ace7609,syn52500358
