The advent of cellular barcoding, however, provides an alternative means by which to group cells: by their clonal origin. We developed ClonoCluster, a computational method that combines both clone and transcriptome information to create hybrid cluste(Read more on Pubmed)",Computational Tool,Melanoma,Skin,GSE140802,Open Access,36819662

Molecular differences in rare individual cells in the initial population enable certain cells to become resistant to therapy<sup>7-9</sup>; however, comparatively little is known about the variability in the resistance outcomes.
