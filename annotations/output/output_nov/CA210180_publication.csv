To investigate metabolic adaptations in the neuron-enriched dentate granule cell (DGC) layer within its native tissue environment, we employed murine acute hippocampal brain slices, coupled with fast metabolite preservation and followed by mass spectrometry (MS) imaging, to generate spatially resolved(Read more on Pubmed)",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,37798473,8f0d9ec7-e39e-4a40-824d-85d861f56e3c,syn52500355
