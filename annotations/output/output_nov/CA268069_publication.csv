This approach studies carcinoma and immune cell dynamics in complex tumor microenvironments (TME) with nonlinear optical imaging platforms. Using a tumor-bearing mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), we detail steps to isolate, activate, and label CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes and later introduce them (Read more on Pubmed)","Imaging, Time Lapse Microscopy",Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma,Pancreas,Not Appicable,Open Access,36861840,47ed9956-1b83-4319-96c9-1e70d00331ff,syn52566262

Quantifying fibrillar collagen organization has become a powerful approach for characterizing the topology of collagen fibers and studying the role of collagen fibers in disease progression. We present a deep learning-based pipel(Read more on Pubmed)",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,37802011,2357765a-37b7-4568-8a1e-4de9f529e998,syn52566262
