Here, we took a structure-based approach to decoupling IFNŒ≥ pleiotropy. We engineered an affinity-enhanced variant of the ligand-binding chain of the IFNŒ≥ receptor IFNŒ≥R1, which enabled us to determin(Read more on Pubmed)","Mass Spectrometry, Next Generation Sequencing, Surface Plasmon Resonance",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,GSE122672,Open Access,30814731,21559026-f668-4050-b171-301a07cb04da,syn52500284
