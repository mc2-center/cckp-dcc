Cancer vaccines require the addition of immunostimulatory adjuvants to increase vaccine immunogenicity, and increasingly multiple adjuvants are used in combination to bolster further and shape cellular immunity to tumor antigens.

Metabolic adaptation is complex and hence better understood by an integrated theoretical-experimental approach. Using a minimal kinetic model, we predicted a previously undescribed Low/Low (L/L) phenotype, characterized by low oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and low glycolysis. Here, we report that L/L metabolism is observed in <i(Read more on Pubmed)","Mathematical Modeling, RNA Sequencing",Melanoma,Skin,Not Appicable,Open Access,32923395,4a6ce342-a1b0-4cf8-8343-235245bcb01c,syn52543482

Even in cancers driven by a single mutated oncogene, variability in response to targeted therapies is well known. The existence of additional genomic alterations among tumor cells can only partially explain this variability. As such, nongenetic factors are increasingly seen as critical contribut(Read more on Pubmed)","Cell Culture, Flow Cytometry, Immunohistochemistry Staining Method, RT-qPCR",Melanoma,Skin,"GSE150083, GSE150084, GSE150025",Open Access,34061819,edee2ac3-e93b-440c-880d-cce3c56f2d40,syn52543482

Highly plastic stem-like states may be inherently drug-resistant. Moreover, cell state dynamics in response to therapy allow a tumor to evade treatment. In both scenarios, quantifying plasticity is essential for identifying high-plasticity states or elucidating transition(Read more on Pubmed)","Mathematical Modeling, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,37731743,6f231c6c-e944-4434-9221-e2d6796ea76b,syn52543482

Traditional reductionist approaches have proven ineffective to ameliorate the uniformly dismal outcomes for SCLC - survival at 5 years remains less than 5%. A major obstacle to improving treatment is that SCLC tumor cells disseminate early, with a strong propensity for metastasizing to the brain.
