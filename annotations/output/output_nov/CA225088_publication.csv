Among the hallmarks of aging, changes in host and cellular metabolism critically affect the development, maintenance, and function of T¬†cells. Although metabolic perturbations impact anti-tumor T¬†cell responses, the link between age-associated metabolic dysfunctio(Read more on Pubmed)",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,36473467,baa32515-2d1e-4555-bacf-668b1b33c58c,syn52564814
