One factor known to contribute to the poor chemotherapy response is the poor drug diffusion into PDAC tumors. Novel treatment methods are therefore drastically needed to improve targeted delivery o(Read more on Pubmed)","Luciferase Reporter Assay, qPCR, Immunohistochemistry Staining Method",Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,37004490,e0eddc2c-bbba-483f-a1d7-9cbdf0cc0e33,syn52564697

We report here for the first time that loss of the RNA-binding protein human antigen R (HuR, <i>ELAVL1</i>) in PDAC cells leads to reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment.

HuR dysregulation has been implicated in various human diseases, particularly cancer. HuR is considered ""active"" in cancer when it shows increased subcellular localization in the cytoplasm, in addition to its normal nuclear localization.
