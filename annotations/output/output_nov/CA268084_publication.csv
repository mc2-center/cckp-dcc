As primary human keratinocytes switch from the progenitor state towards differentiation, most NUPs are strongly downregulated, with NUP93 being the most downregulated NUP in this process. To determine if this NUP downregulation is accompanied by a reduction in nuclear pore numbers, we leveraged Stochasti(Read more on Pubmed)","Cell Culture, Plasmid Construction, Western Blotting, RT-qPCR, Imaging, Confocal Microscopy, RNA Sequencing, Apoptosis Assay, Luciferase Reporter Assay",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,GSE209655,Open Access,37853046,e8fc9c8b-8d3c-4517-b77e-8402bfc10906,syn52566268

A systematic method can help understand the challenges and thereafter optimize the DWP system's performance by customizing the syste(Read more on Pubmed)","Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy, Mathematical Modeling",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,37795311,68d36d1c-638e-418c-85e8-4a793a807f84,syn52566268
