Rational design has led to self-assembling peptides with structural similarities to natural materials. However, recreating the dynamic functional properties inherent to natural systems remains challenging. Here we report the discovery of a short peptide based on(Read more on Pubmed)","Hydrogels, Transmission Electron Microscopy, Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, Cryo-Electron Microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Organoid, Cell Viability Assay, 3D Bioprinting",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,PXD038870,Open Access,37872151,c93f3f91-8c7d-4861-93dc-1db5ed1ec725,syn52566228
