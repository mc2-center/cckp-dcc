For example, mapping cancer genomics has revealed numerous genes that affect the therapeutic outcome of a drug. Through materials and cell engineering, many opportunities exist for engineers to contribute to precision medicine,(Read more on Pubmed)","Immunotherapy, Tissue Engineering, 3D Bioprinting, Organoid",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,30643715,61500490-4687-4bbd-bad8-6f4d6c6c1590,syn52543324
