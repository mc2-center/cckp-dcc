We previously developed CHimeric IMmune Editing (CHIME), a CRISPR-Cas9 bone marrow delivery system for constitutive, ubiquitous deletion of single genes. Here we describe X-CHIME, four new CHIME-based systems for modular and rapid interrogation of gene fun(Read more on Pubmed)",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Restricted Access,38012416,aefd5e57-b1a3-47aa-a162-423de19a740a,syn52564814
