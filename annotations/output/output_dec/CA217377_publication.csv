Here we present Scriabin, a flexible and scalable framework for comparative analysis of cell-cell communication at single-cell(Read more on Pubmed)","Flow Cytometry, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing, CRISPR, Computational Tool",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,GSE228415,Open Access,37169965,968b6638-f88c-4a44-b682-beb57ba6b7ce,syn52543481
