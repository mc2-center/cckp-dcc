Several pathogenic SVA insertions have been identified that directly mutate host genes to cause neurodegenerative and other types of diseases. However, due to their sequence heterogeneity and complex structures as well as limitations in sequencing techniques and analysis,(Read more on Pubmed)",Whole Genome Sequencing,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,37823611
