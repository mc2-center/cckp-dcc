However, no computational methods exist to identify cancer driver genes in mice due to a lack of labeled training data. To address this knowledge gap, we adapted the GUST (Genes Under Selection in Tumors) model, originally trained on human exomes, to mouse exomes via transfer learning. The resulting tool, called GUST-mouse, can estimate(Read more on Pubmed)",Computational Tool,"Breast Neoplasm, Leukemia",Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,37958330,f7d406ab-c052-4fd1-a361-1dcd410dce06,syn52543483
