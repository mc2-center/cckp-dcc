Pathologists deal with issues related to tumor heterogeneity since analyzing a single sample does not necessarily capture a representative depiction of cancer, and a tissue biopsy usually only presents a small fraction of the tumor.

It has been increasingly used for single-cell-based spatial phenotyping in a wide range of samples. However, it only acquires a rectangle field of view (FOV) with a relatively small size and low image resolution, which hinders downstream analysis. Here, we reported a highly practical dual-m(Read more on Pubmed)",Imaging Mass Cytometry,Esophageal Adenocarcinoma,Mucosa,zenodo.7576005,Open Access,37741277,a792b28e-abc2-4dbd-ade7-ccb6dcb16ce0,syn52500282
