To identify effective therapeutic targets, we sought to identify molecular pathways that drive metastasis and HNC progression, through large-scale systematic analyses of transcriptomic data. Methods: We performed meta-analysis acros(Read more on Pubmed)","Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting, Flow Cytometry, RNA Sequencing, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing",Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma,Head and Neck,Not Applicable,Open Access,37978395,d08c2ca9-650e-479f-9a84-74d561565031,syn52500284
