Whether β-arrestins act independently of G protein-mediated signaling has not been fully elucidated. Studies using genome-editing approaches revealed that whereas G proteins are essential for mitogen-activated protein kinase activation by GPCRs., β-arrestins play a more prominent role in s(Read more on Pubmed)","Cell Culture, Confocal Microscopy, RT-qPCR, TIRF Microscopy, Western Blotting, RNA Sequencing, Flow Cytometry",Cervical Carcinoma,Not Applicable,"GSE245270, GSE245789",Open Access,37774973,5ca4cfc4-3754-46c4-add9-2243d7f9aaa9,syn52566271
