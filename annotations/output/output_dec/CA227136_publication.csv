One example is the recognition that patients with IDH-wildtype diffuse astrocytic gliomas demonstrating lower-grade histologic features but genomic and/or epigenomic profile characteristic of glioblastoma typic(Read more on Pubmed),"Next Generation Sequencing, Imaging, Statistical Modeling",Glioblastoma,Brain,Not Applicable,Open Access,35395677,87b05310-e4e4-4e03-b9cc-b41c36bbe02b,syn52564839

The present study aimed to identify the patient, treatment, and imaging features, including measures of sarcopenia, associated with worse survival and 90-day postoperative mortality for elderly patients with GBM.
