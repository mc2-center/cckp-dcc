If the correct naïve T cell encounters its cognate antigen presented by an antigen presenting cell, then the T cell can activate and proliferate. Here, mathematical modeling is used to explore the possibility that immune activation in lymph nodes is a rate-limiting step in anti-cancer immunity and can affect re(Read more on Pubmed)",Mathematical Modeling,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,37949675,8df6d88e-5bdd-43b1-96e8-08804fa6b320,syn52566256
