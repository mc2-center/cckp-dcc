These spheroids may form through single cells that detach and aggregate (Sph-SC) or through collective detachment (Sph-CD). We developed an <i>in vitro</i> model to generate and separate Sph-SC from Sph-CD to enable study of Sph-CD in (Read more on Pubmed)","Immunohistochemistry Staining Method, RT-qPCR, Modeling",High Grade Ovarian Serous Adenocarcinoma,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,36875739,248c68a4-8905-4e6a-84d7-6597a1787f6a,syn52565306
