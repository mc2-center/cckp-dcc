The challenge is to understand how mutations stabilize different kinase configurations to alter function, and how this influences pathogenic potential of the kinase and its responses to therapeutic inhibitors. This goal is made more challenging by the complexity of the mutational landscape of d(Read more on Pubmed)",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Restricted Access,37869794,92ebbad5-a5fd-46d0-9c18-1a3e73c20b62,syn52566224
