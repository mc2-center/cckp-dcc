These effects may be related to suppressed innate and adaptive immunity, decreased immunosurveillance, and disrupted cellular signaling. We hypothesized that anesthetics would promote lung tumor growth via altered immune function in a murine model and tested this using an immunological (Read more on Pubmed)","Modeling, Cell Culture, Immunohistochemistry Staining Method",Lung Carcinoma,"Lung, Liver",Not Applicable,Open Access,37816047,46426c83-6373-40c8-9fbd-c3b8bf8cde3c,syn52499990
