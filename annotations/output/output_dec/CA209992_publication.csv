In this work, we induce wetting (spreading and migration) of cell aggregates, as models of active droplets onto adhesive substrates of varying elasticity and correlate the dynamics of wetting to the balance o(Read more on Pubmed)","Cell Culture, Immunofluorescent Staining Method, Microscopy, Computational Modeling",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,38009085,f35a878d-44db-436c-9d43-3f43b9298293,syn52500281
