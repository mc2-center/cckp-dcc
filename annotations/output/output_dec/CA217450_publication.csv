Transcription factor (TF) networks have been the focus of studies to identify SCLC subtype regulators via systems approaches. Yet, their structures, which can provide clues on subtype drivers and transitions, are barely investigated. Here, we analy(Read more on Pubmed)","Computational Modeling, Mathematical Modeling",Lung Small Cell Carcinoma,Lung,Not Applicable,Open Access,37907529,a0cc5a71-c537-4eb1-a40f-3e6aa9f27b88,syn52543482

While secreted factors from non-NE SCLC cells have been shown to support the growth of the NE cells, the underlying molecular factors are not well understood. Here, we show that exosome-type small extracellular vesicles (SEVs) secreted from non-NE S(Read more on Pubmed)",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Restricted Access,37926756,cf58431e-082d-452b-af57-1ffc17697c66,syn52543482
