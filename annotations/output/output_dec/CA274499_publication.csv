Although conventional mouse models enabled the investigation of BLBC at malignant stages, its initiation and pre-malignant progression remain understudied. Here, we leveraged a mouse genetic system known as mosaic analysis with double markers (MADM) to study BLBC initiation by generating rare(Read more on Pubmed)","Immunohistochemistry Staining Method, Whole Exome Sequencing, Imaging, RNA Sequencing",Basal-Like Breast Carcinoma,Not Applicable,"GSE214433, PRJNA885219",Open Access,37815460,04211cf4-6d90-4978-a05c-beb2b4eee7b5,syn52562080
