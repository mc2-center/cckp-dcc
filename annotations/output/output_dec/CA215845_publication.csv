Transcription factor (TF) networks have been the focus of studies to identify SCLC subtype regulators via systems approaches. Yet, their structures, which can provide clues on subtype drivers and transitions, are barely investigated. Here, we analy(Read more on Pubmed)","Computational Modeling, Mathematical Modeling",Lung Small Cell Carcinoma,Lung,Not Applicable,Open Access,37907529,3ee90fc8-6504-49f9-ab3f-909f2331c94c,syn52543338
