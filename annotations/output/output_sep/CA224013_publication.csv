Although recent large-scale transcriptomic studies have demonstrated that heterogeneous gene expressions play an essential role in determining molecular phenotypes of PDA, biological cues for and consequences of distinct transcriptional programs(Read more on Pubmed)","Cell Culture, Plasmid Construction, RT-PCR, ChIP-Seq, ATAC-Seq, RNA Sequencing",Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma,Pancreas,GSE202534,Open Access,36907523,6d3ba40d-92c6-4396-8d5c-272f9b4a33a6,syn52564792,36907523

Here, we report a targeted delivery platform for cancer treatment using clathrin light chain (CLC)-conjugated drugs. We conjugated CLC to paclitaxel (PTX) through a glutaric anhydride at high efficiency. Labeled CLCs localized to 4T1 tumors implanted in mice, and conjug(Read more on Pubmed)","Electrospray Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry, Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting, siRNA",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,36684105,d2872339-b0ad-44fc-8562-85b599e0332d,syn52564792,36684105
