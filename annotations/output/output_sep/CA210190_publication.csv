We present here ""Rupture And Deliver"" Tension Gauge Tethers (RAD-TGTs) in which flow cytometry is used to record the mechanical history of thousands of cells exerting forces on their surroundings via their propensity to rupture immobilized DNA duple(Read more on Pubmed)","CRISPR, Flow Cytometry, Next Generation Sequencing, Fluorescence Microscopy",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,PRJNA956930,Open Access,37117218,4eec876e-b06d-47f9-9f4d-c24789852714,syn52500358,37117218

However, how changes in conformation and function of individual adhesion proteins regulate the dynamics of whole adhesion complexes remains largely elusive. This is because of the large separation in time and length sca(Read more on Pubmed)",Computational Modeling,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,36947952,4b301af1-4d64-4eab-a8e9-d5466fbb75bb,syn52500358,36947952

Cells can sense environmental stiffness via myosin-generated pulling forces acting on F-actin, which is in turn mechanically coupled to the environment via adhesive proteins, akin to a clutch in a drivetrain. In this ""motor-clutch"" framework, the force transmitted depends on the complex inter(Read more on Pubmed)",Mathematical Modeling,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,37475213,c6eb5240-be49-4514-80a7-6a40e1a8a382,syn52500358,37475213
