Cell types include: Bulge stem cells (B), dermal papilla fibroblasts (DP), secondary hair germ cells (HG), melanocytes (Melan), myeloid cells (Myel) and CD45-posit(Read more on Pubmed)",Whole transcriptome profiling of different skin and hair follicle cell types in normal versus hairy nevus mouse model skin,Mouse,"Flow Cytometry, Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting, Western Blotting, ELISA, RT-PCR, RNA Sequencing, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing",Not Applicable,Not Applicable,,,DatasetView,syn35270567
