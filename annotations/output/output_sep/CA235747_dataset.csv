Here, we define the chromatin accessibility and gene regulatory signatures of osimertinib sensitive and resistant EGFR-mutant cell and patient-derived models and uncover a role for mammalian SWI/SN(Read more on Pubmed)",Mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes promote tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance in EGFR-mutant lung cancer,Human,"Whole Exome Sequencing, RNA Sequencing, ATAC-Seq, CUT&RUN",Lung Adenocarcinoma,Lung,,,DatasetView,syn32698457
