37169593,PXD032403,CA210180,Synthesizing Signaling Pathways from Temporal Phosphoproteomic Data,A quantitative time series of EGFR signaling was acquired using mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics to develop an algorithm that identifies signaling pathway structures. The study used Flp-In 293 cells expressing EGFR that were stimulated with EGF.,"After EGF stimulation for 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128 min, cells were lysed and proteins were extracted, denatured, alkylated and trypsin digested. Peptides were isobarically labeled, enriched using phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies and/or immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), and analyzed on a Velos Pro Elite mass spectrometer.",Human,"Plasmid Construction, Flow Cytometry, Cell Culture, Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry, Cell Proliferation Assay, Migration Assay",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,,,DatasetView,syn32698086,6e5ef953-36e9-440c-b491-74d93f870f0f,syn52745223
