37301933,syn51239112,CA209988,Cancer Drug Responses Using Cell Cycle Phase-Specific Rate Effects,"Identifying effective therapeutic treatment strategies is a major challenge to improving outcomes for patients with breast cancer. To gain a comprehensive understanding of how clinically relevant anti-cancer agents modulate cell cycle progression, we used genetically engineered breast cancer cell lines to track drug-induced changes in cell number and cell cycle phase, which revealed drug-specific (Read more on Pubmed)","To analyze AU565 image data, phase, GFP, and RFP images were overlaid and collated into single files using FIJI46, then segmented into three classes (nuclei, background, debris) using a manually trained classifier in Ilastik. The segmented nuclear masks from Ilastik and the IncuCyte GFP images were used to count the number of nuclei in each image with Cell Profiler. Additionally, using the same im(Read more on Pubmed)",Human,Mathematical Modeling,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,,,DatasetView,syn32698178
