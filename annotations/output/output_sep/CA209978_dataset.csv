34711268,GSE184717,CA209978,Novel temporal and spatial patterns of metastatic colonization from breast cancer rapid-autopsy tumor biopsies,We collected 42 samples from a breast cancer patients including 28 metastatic tumors (which also had DNA samples) and 14 surrounding normal samples. We generated RNAseq data from these samples to study the differential expression of the metastatic tumors.,"RNAseq on 42 sample from the patientâ€™s body at autopsy, including 28 gross tumors and 14 surrounding normal samples.",Human,"Whole Genome Sequencing, RNA Sequencing",Invasive Ductal Breast Carcinoma,Breast,,,DatasetView,syn32698270,ff7ed87d-f300-4d9e-a8d4-525cb55b12a0,syn52745215
37386030,"GSE143944, GSE193278",CA209978,Transcriptional profiling of ribociclib-treated sensitive and ribociclib resistant CAMA-1 cells,Transcriptional response to ribociclib treatment in resistant and sensitive CAMA-1 cells using RNA sequencing. Acquired ribociclib resistant cells were generated by treating CAMA-1 cells over a period of 5 month. Cells were then treated with ribociclib or DMSO control and processed for RNA sequencing.,"Examination of transcriptional response to ribociclib in sensitive and resistant CAMA-1 cells. In total, 12 samples (2 cell lines with 2 treatments, 3 replicates) were analyzed.",Human,"3D Cell Culture, Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry, Western Blotting, RNA Sequencing, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing, Mathematical Modeling",Breast Adenocarcinoma,Breast,,,DatasetView,syn43447174,3ef81f62-65ef-494d-bf00-648f67bc46b6,syn52745215
