However, optimal dosing schedules depend on the properties of metastases, which are often not directly measurable in clinical practice. Here, we proposed a framework for estimating features of metastases through tumor(Read more on Pubmed)",Computational Modeling,Prostate Adenocarcinoma,Prostate Gland,Not Applicable,Open Access,37205789,b747e211-5b2d-470c-8a4f-c094237c27b9,syn52565154,37205789

An alternative approach is to register collections of whole slide images (WSI), generating spatially aligned datasets. WSI registration is a two-part problem, the first being the alignment itself and the second the appl(Read more on Pubmed)",Computational Tool,Colorectal Carcinoma,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,37495577,f07b5a2d-8166-4a03-8180-273f119bbfe9,syn52565154,37495577

These biological phenomena are particularly suited to be captured at the cell-scale resolution possible only within agent-based or individual-based mathematical models.
