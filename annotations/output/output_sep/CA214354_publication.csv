Force elicits TCR catch-slip bonds with strong pMHCs but slip-only bonds with weak pMHCs. We develop two models and apply them to analyze 55 datasets, demonstrating the models' ability to quantitatively integrate and classify a broad range of bond behaviors and biological activities.

However, their role in cancer immunogenicity remains unclear. Here we describe a mechanism by which an HLA-B*0702-specific acute myeloid leukemia phosphoneoantigen, pMLL<sub>747-755</sub> (EPR(pS)PSHSM), is recognized by a cognate T cell receptor named TCR27, a candidate for cancer im(Read more on Pubmed)","Cytotoxicity Assay, X-Ray Crystallography, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,"MZ701715, MZ701716",Open Access,37353482,f2dcae03-9198-426b-b98a-1855f5802171,syn52543316,37353482
