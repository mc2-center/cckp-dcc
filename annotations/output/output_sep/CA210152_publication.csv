Ligand promiscuity among these receptors makes them an interesting target to explore multiple aspects of biased agonism. Here, we comprehensively characterize two chemokine receptors namely, CXCR4 and CXCR7, in terms of their(Read more on Pubmed)","Cell Culture, Chemotaxis Assay

In addition, while immunogenic cell death (ICD) provides a viable approach to inducing anti-tumor immune response, it remains unknown how to effectively trigger ICD while addressing immunosuppressive TAMCs.
