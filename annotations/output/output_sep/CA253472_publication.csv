We found that GPX4, but not the xCT transporter, is selectively elevated in luminal breast cancer. Consistent with this observation, the majority of luminal breast cancer cell lines are exquisitely sensitive to RSL3 with limited sensitivity to erastin. In RSL3-resistant, but (Read more on Pubmed)","Cell Culture, Western Blotting, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis",Luminal A Breast Carcinoma,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,37596261,37596261

However, toxicity and rapid emergence of resistance have limited their clinical implementation. To identify state changes underlying acquisition of resistance to the JQ1 BETi, we reanalyzed single-cell RNAseq data from JQ1 sensitive and resistant SUM149 and S(Read more on Pubmed)","Single Cell ATAC-Seq, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing","Breast Adenocarcinoma, Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma",Breast,"GSE131102, GSE157220, GSE123837, GSE162798, GSE154927, GSE150949, GSE118390, GSE221183",Open Access,37542044,37542044
