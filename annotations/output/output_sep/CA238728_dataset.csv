37444440,GSE223545,CA238728,Functionally and Metabolically Divergent Melanoma-Associated Macrophages Originate from Common Bone-Marrow Precursors,"Melanomas display high numbers of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which correlate with worse prognosis but also retain the potential to restore anti-tumor activity. Harnessing macrophages for therapeutic purposes has been particularly challenging due to their heterogeneity, based on their ontogeny and function and driven by the tissue-specific niche. In the present study, we used the YUMM1.7 (Read more on Pubmed)",Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for F4/80+ macrophages (TAMs) sorted from YUMM1.7 murine melanomas. F4/80high- and F4/80low-expressing TAM profiles were compared using 3 samples from each subset.,Mouse,"Cell Culture, Flow Cytometry, RNA Sequencing, Multiplexed Immunofluorescence",Melanoma,Skin,,,DatasetView,syn35270541
