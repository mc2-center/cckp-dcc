To investigate the origins and impact of such plasticity, we performed single-cell analyses on normal, inflamed, premalignant, and malignant tissues in autochthonous models of pancreatic c(Read more on Pubmed)","Single Cell ATAC-Seq, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing, Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method, Immunohistochemistry Staining Method, smFISH",Pancreatic Neoplasm,Not Applicable,GSE207943,Open Access,37167403,58f98d3e-9ec5-42b1-b9ba-a1c815b3e391,syn52500285,37167403
