The method is based on the transport of a bifunctional substrate comprised of an antigen fused to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, which allows positive selection of bacterial cells co-expressing cytopl(Read more on Pubmed)","Plasmid Construction, ELISA",Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,37316535,37316535

The resulting bioenergetic stress leads to signaling and metabolic adaptation responses in tumor cells, secures survival, and adjusts migration activity. The kinetic responses of cancer cells to energy deficit were recently identified, including a switch of invasive c(Read more on Pubmed)",Modeling,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,36328835,36328835

Mechanical forces and physical confinement can drive various cellular responses, including changes in gene expression, cell growth, differentiation, and migration, all of which have important implications in physiological and pathologica(Read more on Pubmed)",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,37459474,37459474

Although the relationship between bone-matrix mineralization and tumour-cell phenotype in breast cancer is not well understood, mineralization-induced rigidity is thought to drive metastatic progression via increased cell-adhesion forces. Here, by using collagen-based matrices with adjustable intrafib(Read more on Pubmed)",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,"SRX19892051, SRX19892054, SRX19892048, SRX19892050, SRP431246, SRX19892053, SRX19892049, SRX19892052, GSE229094, SRX19892055",Restricted Access,37550422,37550422
