Characterising the hierarchy of the various mammary epithelial cells and how they are regulated in response to gestation, lactation and involution is important for understanding how breast cancer develops. Recent studies have used numerous markers to enrich, isolate and characterise the differ(Read more on Pubmed)","We compared the gene expression profile at single-cell level of four adult developmental time-points of the murine mammary gland. Tissues were harvested at gestation day 14.5 (G), lactation day 6 (L) and day 11 post natural weaning of the pups (PI). Tissue from NP females was harvested at 8 weeks of age. Two individual mice per developmental time point were used in the study.
