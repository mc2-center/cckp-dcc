The role of the lymphatic endothelium in mediating the entry of breast cancer cells into the vasculature remains unclear. Methods: In this study, we formed aggregates of MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells next to human microvascular lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC)-lined cavities in type I coll(Read more on Pubmed)",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,36531861,f1c7eda5-3aa6-473b-98ab-8e87072da52c,syn52500354,36531861

Adipocytes and adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), two resident cell types in adipose tissue, accelerate the early stages of breast cancer progression. It remains unclear whether obesity plays a role in the subsequent escape of malignant breast cancer cells into the local circulation.
