Redox proteomics approaches aim to characterize the landscape of redox PTMs at the systems level. These approaches facilitate studies of condition-specific, dynamic processes implicating redox PTMs and have further(Read more on Pubmed)","Mass Spectrometry, Proteomics Assay",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,37248656,03225c00-2aa5-4a8d-82f0-7714ed0a769b,syn52564853,37248656
