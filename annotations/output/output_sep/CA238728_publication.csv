TAMs are highly abundant in the melanoma tumor microenvironment (TME), usually correlating with worse prognoses. However, the understanding of their diversity may be harnessed for therapeutic purposes. Here, we used the clinically relevant YUMM1.7 model to(Read more on Pubmed)","Cell Culture, Flow Cytometry, RNA Sequencing, Multiplexed Immunofluorescence",Melanoma,Skin,GSE223545,Open Access,37444440,2bf4f883-4b59-4935-9478-4b8c6d3cc717,syn52565390,37444440

Preclinical in vivo model systems and technologies are required to address these knowledge gaps and to surmount the challenges faced in the clinical application of immunotherapy. Mice are commonly used for basic and (Read more on Pubmed),Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,37087398,1b680033-a6ec-46f8-9bd5-a2443012fa1b,syn52565390,37087398
