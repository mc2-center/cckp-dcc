The explicit number of isomers as a function of size is computed using a graph theoretic approach that is compared to a direct count for smaller systems. This allows us to apply a common approach (Read more on Pubmed),Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Restricted Access,37603753
