Translational control is a major regulatory hub in oncogenesis; however, its effects on cancer progression remain poorly understood. Here, to address this, we used ribosome profiling to compare genome-wide translation efficiencies of poorly and highly metast(Read more on Pubmed)","Cell Culture, Cell Proliferation Assay, Migration Assay, Invasion Assay, RT-qPCR, Western Blotting, RNA Sequencing, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing, 3' RNA-seq, eCLIP-Seq, Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry, Co-Immunoprecipitation Mass Spectrometry, Patient Derived Xenograft","Breast Adenocarcinoma, Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma",Breast,"GSE186647, PXD029560",Open Access,37156909,c2bfb538-97f2-4799-8055-65caaf0b2613,syn52500003,37156909
