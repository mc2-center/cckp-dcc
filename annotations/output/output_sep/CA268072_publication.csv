Oblique plane microscopy (OPM) provides high spatiotemporal resolution, but the field of view is typically limited by its optical train and the pixel number of the camera. Mechanically scanning the sample or decreasing the overall magnification of the imaging system can partially(Read more on Pubmed)",Microscopy,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,36733723,32fe8403-1e71-4953-9b1b-56ac2e0e0c50,syn52566269,36733723
