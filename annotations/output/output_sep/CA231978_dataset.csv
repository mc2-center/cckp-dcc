Tumors from 139 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy were analyzed for the expression of 502 cancer-related genes to identify genes differentially regulated in TMPRSS2:ERG fusion tumors as well as identify biomarkers of biochemical recurrence,139 prostate fresh-frozen tumors from radical prostatectomy surgery where profiled on the Illumina Human Cancer DASL Panel. 69 tumors were positive for the gene fusion TMPRSS2:ERG while 70 where not. 33 of the 139 patients experienced biochemical recurrence. Data was analyzed for differential genes in TMPRSS2:ERG fusion positive tumors as well as clinical and molecular biomarkers of recurrence,Human,Computational Tool,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,,,DatasetView,syn32698508
