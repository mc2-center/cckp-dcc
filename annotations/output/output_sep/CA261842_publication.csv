In addition to causing significant respiratory pathology, infection with SARS-CoV-2 (like infection with other respiratory viruses) directly or indirectly results in abnormal vasculature, which may contribute to hypoxemia. These vascular effects ca(Read more on Pubmed)",Mathematical Modeling,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,33648989,544ae5c1-20ed-4dd4-8626-92e052dc4608,syn52566256,33648989

TB-403 is a blocking monoclonal antibody against PlGF that inhibits tumor growth and increases survival in orthotopic medulloblastoma models. Patients and methods: We conducted a phase I, open-label(Read more on Pubmed)",Clinical Study,"Medulloblastoma, Neuroblastoma, Ewing Sarcoma, Rhabdomyosarcoma",Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,35833850,2bef03fc-dc1b-486a-8312-9e2f42e56eb7,syn52566256,35833850
