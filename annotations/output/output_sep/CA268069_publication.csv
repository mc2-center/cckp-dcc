However, FLIM of NAD(P)H has not been performed in a light-sheet geometry, which is advantageous for rapid imaging of cells within live 3D samples.

However, how changes in conformation and function of individual adhesion proteins regulate the dynamics of whole adhesion complexes remains largely elusive.
