We present an innovative approach to improve chemotherapy efficacy in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer. The effectiveness of various chemotherapies, including standard of care FOLFIRINOX, was remarkably enhanced by inducing a state (Read more on Pubmed)",Orthotopic tumors under hyperglycemic (D30) compared to normoglycemic condition.
