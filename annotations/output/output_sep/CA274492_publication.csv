To investigate the origins and impact of such plasticity, we performed single-cell analyses on normal, inflamed, premalignant, and malignant tissues in autochthonous models of pancreatic c(Read more on Pubmed)","Single Cell ATAC-Seq, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing, Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method, Immunohistochemistry Staining Method, smFISH",Pancreatic Neoplasm,Not Applicable,GSE207943,Open Access,37167403,9290dbc5-500a-41f8-b413-f9942a98f5ee,syn52566272,37167403
