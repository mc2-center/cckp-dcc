CSN5, a putative androgen receptor (AR) partner that is located on chromosome 8q, is the key subunit of the COP9 signalosome, which deactivates ubiquitin ligases. Deregulation of CSN5 could affect diverse cellular functions that contribute to tumor devel(Read more on Pubmed)","Cell Culture, CUT&Tag-Sequencing, RNA Sequencing, Xenograft",Prostate Adenocarcinoma,Prostate Gland,"GSE173469, GSE173466, GSE173467",Open Access,34802033,94fb53c7-d0a3-495e-b47f-c6d2a9140042,syn52564788,34802033

We generated a genetically engineered mouse with prostate-specific expression of the <i>ETS</i> factor, ETV4, at lower and higher protein dosage through mutation of its degron.
