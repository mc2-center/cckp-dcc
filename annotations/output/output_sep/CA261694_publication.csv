However, the interplay between the mechanical and signaling processes that drive dynamic behavior in vascular endothelial cells is not well understood. In this study, we propose a chemo-mechanical model to investigate the re(Read more on Pubmed)","Electron Microscopy, Computational Modeling",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,36402771,0170e5ab-3bf0-4e37-b260-5b6be339e3ad,syn52566248,36402771

As such, clinical studies have provided evidence that markers associated with elevated levels of coagulation and fibrinolysis correlate with decreased patient survival.

The resulting bioenergetic stress leads to signaling and metabolic adaptation responses in tumor cells, secures survival, and adjusts migration activity. The kinetic responses of cancer cells to energy deficit were recently identified, including a switch of invasive c(Read more on Pubmed)",Modeling,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,36328835,a84c3efe-c64f-4b64-bbe4-d7eb2d0fa8f8,syn52566248,36328835

Individual podosomes probe their microenvironment through periodic protrusion and retraction cycles (height oscillations), while oscillations of multiple podosomes in a cluster are coordinated in a wave-like fashion.
