A major barrier in the field has been the relative paucity of human tumors studied. Here we provide an integrated analysis of 3,600 ""real-world"" SCLC cases. This large cohort allowed us to identify new recurrent alterations and genetic subtypes, including STK11-mutant tumors (1.7%) and TP53/RB1 (Read more on Pubmed)","Next Generation Sequencing, Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method","Lung Non-Small Cell Carcinoma, Lung Small Cell Carcinoma, Lung Adenocarcinoma",Lung,Not Applicable,Open Access,37062002,3fc20b5f-f546-4e72-a379-91d9b1983efa,syn52543482,37062002
