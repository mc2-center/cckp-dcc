This method seeks to engineer immune cells expressing an artificially designed receptor, which would endue those cells with the ability to recognize and eliminate tumor cells. While some CAR therapies received FDA approval and others are subject to clinical trials, many aspects(Read more on Pubmed)","Immunotherapy, Computational Modeling",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,37263529,c56a2198-19e5-4543-b445-b6a5c9272db1,syn53129725,37263529
