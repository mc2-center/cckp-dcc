Effective alternative therapies have yet to emerge, as chemotherapy remains the best available systemic treatment. However, the discovery of safe and available adjuncts to enhance chemotherapeutic efficacy can still improve survival outcomes. We show that a hyperglycemic state substantially enhances the efficacy of conven(Read more on Pubmed)","Cell Culture, CRISPR, RT-qPCR, RNA Sequencing, Immunohistochemistry Staining Method",Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma,Pancreas,GSE194369,Open Access,37380658,807a313f-7194-4827-bf50-edd98da8dfcc,syn52564697,37380658

Here, we exploit the concept of ""trajectory embedding"" to analyze cellular behavior using morphological feature trajectory histories-that is, multiple time points simultaneously, rather than the more common practice of (Read more on Pubmed)",Imaging,Breast Neoplasm,Breast,Not Applicable,Open Access,37142678,3b3963c0-c557-49ec-a7ef-595ebbf149a5,syn52564697,37142678
