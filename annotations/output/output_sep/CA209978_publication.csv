Here, we study interactions between estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell lineages that are sensitive and resistant to ribociclib-induced cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibition.

Tracking metastatic spread in living patients is difficult and thus poorly understood. Methods: Via rapid autopsy, we have collected 30 tumor samples over 3 timepoints and across 8 organs from a triple-negative metastatic breast cancer patient. The large number of sites sampled, together with deep whole-genom(Read more on Pubmed)","Whole Genome Sequencing, RNA Sequencing",Invasive Ductal Breast Carcinoma,Breast,GSE184717,Open Access,34711268,2e6323d7-ccfa-40f7-a2fa-8ac2b01ff1a7,syn52500283,34711268

By reconstructing the course of cancer evolution, we can understand the acquisition of the malignant properties that drive tumor progression.
