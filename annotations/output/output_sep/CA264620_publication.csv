Here, we study interactions between estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell lineages that are sensitive and resistant to ribociclib-induced cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibition.

By reconstructing the course of cancer evolution, we can understand the acquisition of the malignant properties that drive tumor progression. Unfortunately, recovering the evolutionary relationships of individual cancer cells linked to their phenot(Read more on Pubmed)",Single Cell RNA-Sequencing,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,37553438,15a663fd-d092-466c-b2f7-bbfac14bee81,syn53129715,37553438
