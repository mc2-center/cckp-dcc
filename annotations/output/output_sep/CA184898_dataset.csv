It is, however, commonly accepted that this classification scheme has limited clinical utility based on its lack of reproducibility in predicting patient outcome. We aimed at establishing a reliable molecular classification using DNA methylation fingerprints and gene expression data of the tumors on a larg(Read more on Pubmed)",Total RNA from 209 ependymal tumor samples were hybridised to the Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays.,Human,"Hi-C, Structural Variant Analysis, ChIP-Seq, Cell Culture, Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting, Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing, CUT&Tag-Sequencing, Angiogenesis Assay",Ependymoma,Brain,,,DatasetView,syn32698262
