37386030,"GSE143944, GSE193278",CA264620,Transcriptional profiling of ribociclib-treated sensitive and ribociclib resistant CAMA-1 cells,Transcriptional response to ribociclib treatment in resistant and sensitive CAMA-1 cells using RNA sequencing. Acquired ribociclib resistant cells were generated by treating CAMA-1 cells over a period of 5 month. Cells were then treated with ribociclib or DMSO control and processed for RNA sequencing.,"Examination of transcriptional response to ribociclib in sensitive and resistant CAMA-1 cells. In total, 12 samples (2 cell lines with 2 treatments, 3 replicates) were analyzed.",Human,"3D Cell Culture, Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry, Western Blotting, RNA Sequencing, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing, Mathematical Modeling",Breast Adenocarcinoma,Breast,,,DatasetView,syn43447174
