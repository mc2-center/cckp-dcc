However, their role in cancer immunogenicity remains unclear. Here we describe a mechanism by which an HLA-B*0702-specific acute myeloid leukemia phosphoneoantigen, pMLL747–755 (EPR(pS)PSHSM), is recognized by a cognate T cell receptor named TCR27, a candidate for cancer immunotherapy(Read more on Pubmed)","Synthetic construct alpha chain of TCR (trav) gene, TRAV27*01 allele, complete cds",,"Cytotoxicity Assay, X-Ray Crystallography, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,,,DatasetView,syn32698096
