However, current dimensionality reduction methods aggregate sparse gene information across cells, without directly measuring the relationships that exist between genes. By performing dimensionality reduction with respect to gene co-expression, low-dimensional fe(Read more on Pubmed)",Computational Modeling,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,"GSE158803, GSE96583",Open Access,37474509,40490279-e4a8-4800-8450-b7fdf89e457c,syn52565143,37474509
