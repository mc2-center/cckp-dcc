An alternative approach is to register collections of whole slide images (WSI), generating spatially aligned datasets. WSI registration is a two-part problem, the first being the alignment itself and the second the appl(Read more on Pubmed)",Computational Tool,Colorectal Carcinoma,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,37495577,dc85447c-129e-418b-9d2e-0bfaaa960ef5,syn52499990,37495577
