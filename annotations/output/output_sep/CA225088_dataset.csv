37069550,GSE221595,CA225088,Highly efficient and multiplexed transcriptome profiling of cardiotoxicity induced by tyrosine kinase inhibitors,"yrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are anti-cancer therapeutics used in long-term treatment. However, many of them cause cardiotoxicity with limited cure. We aim to define molecular mechanisms of cardiotoxicity that can be targeted for oncocardiology treatment. Eight TKIs with different levels of cardiotoxicity were selected and transcriptome responses of human cardiomyocytes to them at varying dose(Read more on Pubmed)","Comparative transcriptome of human cardiomyocytes treated with 8 FDA-approved TKIs. For 2 of the TKIs (Crizotinib and Ponatinib), treatments were done with 0,316µM at day 1, 3 and 5, as well as 1 and 3.16 µM at day 1. For 6 of the TKIs (Afatinib, Dasatinib, Gefitinib, Nilotinib, Ponatinib, Sorafenib and Sunitinib), treatments were done with 3.16 µM at day 1, 3 and 5, as well as 1 and 10 µM at day (Read more on Pubmed)",Human,Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-derived Cardiomyocytes Culture,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,,,DatasetView,syn32698104,a61387ee-c159-4aa5-accf-0e2a51613f51,syn52745293
37059105,syn30715952,CA225088,Lymphocyte networks are dynamic cellular communities in the immunoregulatory landscape of lung adenocarcinoma,"Lymphocytes are integral to controlling tumor progression, but our understanding of the spatial organization and physical interactions that facilitate their anti-cancer function is limited. Here, we use multiplexed imaging, quantitative spatial analysis, and machine learning to create high-definition maps of tumor-bearing lung tissues from the KP (Kras/p53) mouse model and human lung cancer resect(Read more on Pubmed)",,,"Cyclic Immunofluorescence, Imaging",Lung Adenocarcinoma,Lung,,,DatasetView,syn32698438,67e4030a-8176-43dc-9197-7a4ddd861f33,syn52745293
