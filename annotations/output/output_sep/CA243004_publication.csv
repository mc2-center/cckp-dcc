To overcome this challenge, often referred to as the ""small n, large p problem,"" we exploit known organizing principles of biological networks that are sparse, modular, and likely share a large portion of their under(Read more on Pubmed)",Computational Modeling,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,37200395,db0889f9-cdc3-4e29-b8f9-2be875daa4d9,syn52565480,37200395

The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway constitutes an important target to restore functional anti-tumor immune response. Here, we report that BET protein inhibition suppresses PD-1/PD-L1 in triple-negative breast cancer. BET proteins control PD-1 expression in T cells,(Read more on Pubmed)","Flow Cytometry, Immunoprecipitation","Breast Adenocarcinoma, Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma",Breast,Not Applicable,Open Access,31473251,3834f2a4-c075-4d2b-a99b-be4250a80cb2,syn52565480,31473251
