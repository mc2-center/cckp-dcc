To gain a comprehensive understanding of how clinically relevant anti-cancer agents modulate cell cycle progression, here we use genetically engineered breast cancer cell lines to track drug-induced changes in cell number and cell cycle phase to reveal drug-specific ce(Read more on Pubmed)",Mathematical Modeling,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,syn51239112,Open Access,37301933,37301933

We here introduce MOBILE (Multi-Omics Binary Integration via Lasso Ensembles) to nominate molecular features associated with cellular phenotypes and pathways. First, we use MOBILE to nominate mechanisms of interferon-γ (IFNγ) regulated PD-L1 expression. Our analyses suggest that IFNγ-co(Read more on Pubmed)","Computational Tool, Computational Modeling",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,syn21577710,Open Access,37414767,37414767

However, toxicity and rapid emergence of resistance have limited their clinical implementation. To identify state changes underlying acquisition of resistance to the JQ1 BETi, we reanalyzed single-cell RNAseq data from JQ1 sensitive and resistant SUM149 and S(Read more on Pubmed)","Single Cell ATAC-Seq, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing","Breast Adenocarcinoma, Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma",Breast,"GSE131102, GSE157220, GSE123837, GSE162798, GSE154927, GSE150949, GSE118390, GSE221183",Open Access,37542044,37542044
