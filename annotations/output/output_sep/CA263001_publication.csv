Solar UV exposure transforms melanocytes into highly mutated tumor cells that metastasize to the liver, lungs, and brain. Even upon resection of the primary tumor, almost thirty percent of patients succumb to melanoma within twenty years. Identification of key melanoma genetic drivers led (Read more on Pubmed)",Immunotherapy,Melanoma,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,36497341,cdc5c421-f4d9-4ad5-9f14-3cbc441e7fb0,syn52566257,36497341
