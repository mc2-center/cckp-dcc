We subjected single-cell suspensions derived from surgical resections of gastrointestinal cancer tissue, paired normal tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to high-throughput microfluidics based single-cell RNA sequencing. We analyzed the features of the tumor microenvironment incl(Read more on Pubmed)",Whole transcriptome sequencing,Human,"Single Cell RNA-Sequencing, RNA Sequencing
