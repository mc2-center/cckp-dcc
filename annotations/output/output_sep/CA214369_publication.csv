Here, we present a hydrogel that locally delivers adoptively transferred T cells to the tumor site while recruiting and activating host antigen-presenting cells with GMCSF or FLT3(Read more on Pubmed)","Flow Cytometry, Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method

However, few biological matrices enable good print fidelity, while simultaneously facilitate cell viability, proliferation, and migration. Here, a new microporogen-structured (µPOROS) matrix for embedded bioprinting is introduced, in which matrix rheology, printing behavior(Read more on Pubmed)",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,37163476,1619bf76-a29b-467a-a8d9-2f36944cf2e8,syn52543323,37163476
