A mathematical model is typically constructed using expert knowledge and informal reasoning to generate a mechanistic explanation for a given observation. Although this approach works well for simple systems with abundant data and well-established principles, quantitative biology is o(Read more on Pubmed)",Mathematical Modeling,Lung Small Cell Carcinoma,Lung,Not Applicable,Open Access,37406008,2d131ed6-441d-4311-afee-843148ff8413,syn52543338,37406008
