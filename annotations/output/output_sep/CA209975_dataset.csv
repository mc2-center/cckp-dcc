37127830,GSE202157,CA209975,Conserved transcriptional connectivity of regulatory T cells in the tumor microenvironment informs novel combination cancer therapy strategies,"While regulatory T (Treg) cells are traditionally viewed as professional suppressors of antigen presenting and effector T cells in both autoimmunity and cancer, recent findings of distinct Treg functions in tissue maintenance suggest that their regulatory purview extends to a wider range of cells and is broader than previously assumed. To elucidate tumoral Treg “connectivity” to diverse tumor-supp(Read more on Pubmed)","Three mouse sets of data are deposited.
1. KP Lung Adenocarcinoma and stromal cells were collected from KrasLSL-G12D/WTTrp53fl/fl Foxp3GFP-DTR (KP-DTR) mice harboring ~3 months old Adenicarcinomas, following 48 hr treatment with Diphteria toxin (DT) to deplete Tregs, or PBS as control.
