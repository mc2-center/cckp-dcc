However, current treatment protocols do not account for this plasticity. Previously, we generated a mathematical model based on preclinical experiments to describe this (Read more on Pubmed)",Mathematical Modeling,Glioblastoma,Brain,Not Applicable,Open Access,36402744,d354c837-2607-4a98-b257-c3c5e7e534ea,syn52499989,36402744

We previously identified TGFβ signaling as a candidate regulator of mammary epithelial cells associated with breast cancer risk. Here, we show that short-term TGFBR inhibitor (TGFBRi) treatment of peripubertal ACI inbred and Sprague Dawley outbred rats induces lasting changes and prevents estrogen- and carcinogen(Read more on Pubmed)","Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting, Flow Cytometry, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing, RNA Sequencing","Breast Adenocarcinoma, Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma, Invasive Ductal Breast Carcinoma",Breast,"GSE106273, GSE161529, GSE184095",Open Access,36476730,eea97fc7-2efc-4a1a-9a8e-a9b5e274c480,syn52499989,36476730
