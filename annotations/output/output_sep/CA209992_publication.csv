Here we analyzed a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of early SARS-CoV-2 infection in a humanized <i>inÂ vitro</i> model, to elucidate key mechanisms by which the virus trigge(Read more on Pubmed)",Single Cell RNA-Sequencing,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,GSE166766,Open Access,36788793,0aba4cb7-f5cf-45e4-8b2e-c769c7ef4d61,syn52500281,36788793

Hence, we investigated whether it is possible to genetically reprogram T cells to exploit a common tumor-intrinsic evasion mechanism whereby cancer cells suppress T-cell function by generating a metabolically unfavorable tumor microenvironment (TME).
