This leads to aberrantly high Notch signaling, but how this translates into deregulated cell cycle control and the transformed cell type is poorly understood. In this report, we analyze downstream responses resulting from the high level of NOTCH 1 signaling in T-ALL. Notch activity, measured immediately downst(Read more on Pubmed)",Three independent cultures of the MOLT4 cell line before and 48 hours after addition of the gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT (5 uM).,Human,Computational Tool,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,,,DatasetView,syn43447140
