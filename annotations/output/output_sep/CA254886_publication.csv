To investigate this, we developed a live-cell method to measure changes in chromosome numbers. We edited constitutive genes with GFP or RFP tags on single alleles and discovered that cells that lose Chromosome reporters (ChReporters) become non-fluorescent. We appl(Read more on Pubmed)",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,37288769,95848203-6bef-4e23-8d9a-764945e5ada8,syn52566240,37288769

FDs are phase-separated liquids with a poorly understood interfacial tension Î³ that determines how FDs interact with other organelles. Here, micron-sized FDs remain spherical as they indent peri-nuclear actomyosin and the nucleus, while causing local di(Read more on Pubmed)",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,37212777,fae56dc8-957e-4639-9c86-4a4b0b5f66a3,syn52566240,37212777
