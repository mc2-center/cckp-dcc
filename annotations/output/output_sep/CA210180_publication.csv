PublicationView,CA210180,10.26508/lsa.202201466,Life Sci Alliance,37169593,Predictive data-driven modeling of C-terminal tyrosine function in the EGFR signaling network,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37169593,2023,,"Jacqueline S Gerritsen, Joseph S Faraguna, Rudy Bonavia, Frank B Furnari, Forest M White","The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been studied extensively because of its critical role in cellular signaling and association with disease. Previous models have elucidated interactions between EGFR and downstream adaptor proteins or showed phenotypes affected by EGFR. However, the link between specific EGFR phosphorylation sites and phenotypic outcomes is still poorly understood.

It remains unknown if blood-brain barrier disruption merely reflects or functionally supports glioma aggressiveness. We utilised intra-operative microdialysis to sample the extracellular metabolome of radiographically diverse regions of gliomas and evaluated the global extracellular metabolome via ultra-performance liquid chromatograph(Read more on Pubmed),"Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis","Glioblastoma, Glioma",Brain,Not Applicable,Open Access,37340056,b3140332-8494-4c03-9a47-bd01196d2949,syn52500355,37340056
