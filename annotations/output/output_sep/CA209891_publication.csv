The mechanistic role dimerization plays in PEAK scaffolding remains unclear, as there are no structures of PEAKs in complex with their interactors. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of dimeric PEAK3 in complex with an endogenous 14-3-3 heterodimer.(Read more on Pubmed)","Cell Culture, Cryo-Electron Microscopy, Co-Immunoprecipitation, Co-Immunoprecipitation Mass Spectrometry, Immunofluorescent Staining Method

An ongoing challenge is to determine the proteins orchestrating DDR and their organization into complexes, including constitutive interactions and those responding to genomic insult.

However, many cancers do not respond to ICB, prompting the search for additional strategies to achieve durable responses.
