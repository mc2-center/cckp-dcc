Structures with a sequence similarity of 30% to 14-3-3Îµ and an E-value cutoff of 0.1 were manually curated, removing 14-3-3 structures that only contained client peptides, with no globular domains present. Following curation, structures(Read more on Pubmed)",Human,"Cell Culture, Cryo-Electron Microscopy, Co-Immunoprecipitation, Co-Immunoprecipitation Mass Spectrometry, Immunofluorescent Staining Method
