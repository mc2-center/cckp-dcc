From a clinical standpoint, G3 NENs are usually grouped regardless of primary site and treated similarly. Little is known regarding the underlying genomics of these rare tumors, especially when compared across different primary sites. We performed whole transcriptome (n = 46), whole exome (n = 40), and gene copy n(Read more on Pubmed)","Whole Exome Sequencing, Whole Genome Sequencing, RNA Sequencing, Immunohistochemistry Staining Method", Neuroendocrine Neoplasm,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,36165930,2d67cf39-1af6-4346-a254-f0d03781f9d1,syn52566245,36165930

Its microenvironment is modified to provide a niche that is conducive for colorectal cancer cell growth. This study focused on characterizing the cellular changes in the metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) liver tumor microenvironment (TME).
