PublicationView,CA253540,10.1038/s41598-023-37238-2,Sci Rep,37369672,Comparing mechanism-based and machine learning models for predicting the effects of glucose accessibility on tumor cell proliferation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37369672,2023,,"Jianchen Yang, Jack Virostko, Junyan Liu, Angela M Jarrett, David A Hormuth, Thomas E Yankeelov","Glucose plays a central role in tumor metabolism and development and is a target for novel therapeutics. To characterize the response of cancer cells to blockade of glucose uptake, we collected time-resolved microscopy data to track the growth of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. We then developed a mechanism-based, mathematical model to predict how a glucose transporter (GLUT1) inhibitor (Cytochala(Read more on Pubmed)","Cell Culture, Imaging, Mathematical Modeling, Computational Modeling","Breast Adenocarcinoma, Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma",Breast,Not Applicable,Open Access,37369672,4bdc26c6-9da1-4763-9eb3-128817f2a433,syn52566223,37369672

Coupling cellular barcoding with single-cell transcriptomics permits the longitudinal analysis of molecular mechanisms with detailed clone-level resolution. Numerous recent studies have employed these tools to track clonal cell states in ca(Read more on Pubmed),Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,37105856,8d4b227b-5746-4aa1-8670-eff189e5f6de,syn52566223,37105856

While digital twins have been widely used in engineering for decades, their applications to oncology are only just emerging.
