These definitions tend to describe what cancer ""looks like"" or ""does"" but do not describe what cancer ""is"" or ""has become.""

At the tumor migration front, cancer cell clusters are surrounded by an aligned stromal topography. It remains unknown whether aligned stromal topography regulates the resistance of migrating cancer cell clusters to therapeutics.
