Recent advances in spatial transcriptomics (ST) have enabled the comprehensive characterization of gene expression in the TME. However, popular ST platforms, such as Visium, only measure expression in low-resolution spots and (Read more on Pubmed)","Imaging, Computational Tool",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,"GSE175540, GSE72056, GSE144240",Open Access,37164011,37164011
