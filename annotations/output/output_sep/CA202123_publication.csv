In particular, complex biophysical mechanisms enable a tumor to remodel the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), allowing cells to invade alone or collectively. Tumor spheroids cultured in collagen represent a simplified, reproducible 3D model system, which is sufficie(Read more on Pubmed)",Computational Modeling,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,36996248,7f55ab60-a2aa-47c3-a721-9d074fad759a,syn52500080,36996248

Here, we sought to better understand the mechanism through which MIM-B promotes tumor metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

We have hypothesized that the increased stiffness directly contributes to the dysregulation of the epithelial cell homeostasis in IBD.
