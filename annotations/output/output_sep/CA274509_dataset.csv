To identify the underlying genetic and transcriptomic landscapes, in this study we analyzed multi-organ metastases and tumor-adjacent tissues from 11 rapid autopsies after treatment with MAPK inhibitor (MAPKi) and/or immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and death due to ac(Read more on Pubmed)","This dataset includes WES, WGS, and RNAseq data generated from autopsy samples.",,"Patient Derived Xenograft, RNA Sequencing, Whole Genome Sequencing, Whole Exome Sequencing, Structural Variant Analysis",Cutaneous Melanoma,Skin,,,DatasetView,
