PublicationView,CA250044,10.1016/j.isci.2022.104721,iScience,35865140,Data driven and biophysical insights into the regulation of trafficking vesicles by extracellular matrix stiffness,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35865140,2022,"Cancer, Biophysics, immunology, Mathematical Biosciences, Biocomputational Method","Kshitiz Parihar, Jonathan Nukpezah, Daniel V Iwamoto, Paul A Janmey, Ravi Radhakrishnan","Biomechanical signals from remodeled extracellular matrix (ECM) promote tumor progression. Here, we show that cell-matrix and cell-cell communication may be inherently linked and tuned through mechanisms of mechanosensitive biogenesis of trafficking vesicles. Pan-cancer analysis of cancer cells' mechanical properties (focusing primarily on cell stiffness) on substrates of varied stiffness and comp(Read more on Pubmed)",RNA Sequencing,Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,syn7248578,Open Access,35865140,651f6210-6bd0-4236-8424-9bfe0c43f548,syn52566224,35865140

A greater abundance of aligned fibrillar collagen is characteristic of invasive and aggressive breast cancers and has been associated with elevated activity of collagen crosslinking enzymes, such as lysyl oxidase (LOX) and lysyl hydroxylases (LH) and the formation of more mature collagen matrix crosslinks.
