Both quantities are low in hematologic ""liquid"" cancers versus solid tumors in data of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) that also shows the fraction of a genome affected by LOH is ~ one-half of that with CNV. Suspension cultures of p53-null THP-1 leukemia-derived cells conform to these trends, despite novel evidence here of genetic heterogeneity and transiently elevated CNV after perturbation. Single-cell DNAseq indeed reveals at least 8 distinct THP-1 aneuploid clones with further intra-clonal variation, suggesting ongoing genetic evolution. Importantly, acute inhibition of the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) produces CNV levels that are typical of high-CNV solid tumors, with subsequent cell death and down-selection to novel CNV. Pan-cancer analyses show p53 inactivation associates with aneuploidy, but leukemias exhibit a weaker trend even though p53 inactivation correlates with poor survival. Overexpression of p53 in THP-1 does not rescue established aneuploidy or LOH but slightly increases cell death under oxidative or confinement stress, and triggers p21, a key p53 target, but without affecting net growth. Our results suggest that factors other than p53 exert stronger pressures against aneuploidy in liquid cancers, and identifying such CNV suppressors could be useful across liquid and solid tumor types.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,924a7f5e-39ca-445a-99d5-6efb7c0d5974,syn52407758
