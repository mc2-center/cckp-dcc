Typically, hypoxia is viewed as a negative marker of patients' survival, because of its implication in the development of aggressive tumors and tumor resistance. Several drugs that specifically target the hypoxic cells have been developed, providing an opportunity for exploiting hypoxia to improve cancer treatment. Here, we consider combinations of hypoxia-activated pro-drugs (HAPs) and two compounds that transiently increase intratumoral hypoxia: a vasodilator and a metabolic sensitizer. To effectively design treatment protocols with multiple compounds we used mathematical micro-pharmacology modeling and determined treatment schedules that take advantage of heterogeneous and dynamically changing oxygenation in tumor tissue. Our model was based on data from murine pancreatic cancers treated with evofosfamide (as a HAP) and either hydralazine (as a vasodilator), or pyruvate (as a metabolic sensitizer). Subsequently, this model was used to identify optimal schedules for different treatment combinations. Our simulations showed that schedules of HAPs with the vasodilator had a bimodal distribution, while HAPs with the sensitizer showed an elongated plateau. All schedules were more successful than HAP monotherapy. The three-compound combination had three local optima, depending on the HAPs clearance from the tissue interstitium, each two-fold more effective than baseline HAP treatment. Our study indicates that the three-compound therapy administered in the defined order will improve cancer response and that designing complex schedules could benefit from the use of mathematical modeling.",Mathematical Modeling,Pancreatic Carcinoma,Pancreas,Not Applicable,Open Access,

A promising approach is leveraging multiplexed tissue analysis techniques such as cyclic immunofluorescence (CyCIF), which enable visualization and quantification of 10-60 antigens at single-cell resolution from individual tissue sections. In this study, we qualified a breast cancer-specific antibody panel, including HER2, ER, and PR, for multiplexed tissue imaging. We then compared the performance of these antibodies against established clinical standards using pixel-, cell- and tissue-level analyses, utilizing 866 tissue cores (representing 294 patients). To ensure reliability, the CyCIF antibodies were qualified against HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) data from the same samples. Our findings demonstrate the successful qualification of a breast cancer antibody panel for CyCIF, showing high concordance with established clinical antibodies. Subsequently, we employed the qualified antibodies, along with antibodies for CD45, CD68, PD-L1, p53, Ki67, pRB, and AR, to characterize 567 HER2+ invasive breast cancer samples from 189 patients. Through single-cell analysis, we identified four distinct cell clusters within HER2+ breast cancer exhibiting heterogeneous HER2 expression. Furthermore, these clusters displayed variations in ER, PR, p53, AR, and PD-L1 expression. To quantify the extent of heterogeneity, we calculated heterogeneity scores based on the diversity among these clusters. Our analysis revealed expression patterns that are relevant to breast cancer biology, with correlations to HER2 ITH and potential relevance to clinical outcomes.","Cyclic Immunofluorescence, Imaging       ",Breast Carcinoma,Breast,Not Applicable,Open Access,

However, the complexity of bone marrow cellular, morphologic, and spatial architecture preserved in trephine samples hinders comprehensive evaluation. To dissect the diverse cellular communities and mosaic tissue habitats, we developed a superpixel-inspired deep learning method (MoSaicNet) that adapts to complex tissue architectures and a cell imbalance aware deep learning pipeline (AwareNet) to enable accurate detection and classification of rare cell types in multiplex immunohistochemistry images. MoSaicNet and AwareNet achieved an AUC of >0.98 for tissue and cellular classification on separate test datasets. Application of MoSaicNet and AwareNet enabled investigation of bone heterogeneity and thickness as well as spatial histology analysis of bone marrow trephine samples from monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance (MGUS) and from paired newly diagnosed and posttreatment multiple myeloma. The most significant difference between MGUS and newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) samples was not related to cell density but to spatial heterogeneity, with reduced spatial proximity of BLIMP1+ tumor cells to CD8+ cells in MGUS compared with NDMM samples. Following treatment of patients with multiple myeloma, there was a reduction in the density of BLIMP1+ tumor cells, effector CD8+ T cells, and regulatory T cells, indicative of an altered immune microenvironment. Finally, bone heterogeneity decreased following treatment of patients with multiple myeloma. In summary, deep learning-based spatial mapping of bone marrow trephine biopsies can provide insights into the cellular topography of the myeloma marrow microenvironment and complement aspirate-based techniques. Significance: Spatial analysis of bone marrow trephine biopsies using histology, deep learning, and tailored algorithms reveals the bone marrow architectural heterogeneity and evolution during myeloma progression and treatment.",Deep Learning,Multiple Myeloma,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,

ORF2p reverse transcriptase (RT) and endonuclease activities have been implicated in the pathophysiology of cancer<sup>2,3</sup>, autoimmunity<sup>4,5</sup> and ageing<sup>6,7</sup>, making ORF2p a potential therapeutic target. However, a lack of structural and mechanistic knowledge has hampered efforts to rationally exploit it. We report structures of the human ORF2p 'core' (residues 238-1061, including the RT domain) by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy in several conformational states. Our analyses identified two previously undescribed folded domains, extensive contacts to RNA templates and associated adaptations that contribute to unique aspects of the L1 replication cycle. Computed integrative structural models of full-length ORF2p show a dynamic closed-ring conformation that appears to open during retrotransposition. We characterize ORF2p RT inhibition and reveal its underlying structural basis. Imaging and biochemistry show that non-canonical cytosolic ORF2p RT activity can produce RNA:DNA hybrids, activating innate immune signalling through cGAS/STING and resulting in interferon production<sup>6-8</sup>. In contrast to retroviral RTs, L1 RT is efficiently primed by short RNAs and hairpins, which probably explains cytosolic priming. Other biochemical activities including processivity, DNA-directed polymerization, non-templated base addition and template switching together allow us to propose a revised L1 insertion model. Finally, our evolutionary analysis demonstrates structural conservation between ORF2p and other RNA- and DNA-dependent polymerases. We therefore provide key mechanistic insights into L1 polymerization and insertion, shed light on the evolutionary history of L1 and enable rational drug development targeting L1.","X-Ray Crystallography, Cryo-Electron Microscopy, Modeling",Pan-cancer,Not Applicable,PXD038615,Open Access,

These methods hinder the ability to monitor therapy over time. Preclinical studies typically begin treatment before mice develop myelofibrosis, unlike patients who begin therapy only after onset of disease. Using clinically relevant, quantitative MRI metrics allowed us to evaluate treatment in mice with established myelofibrosis. Methods: We used chemical shift-encoded fat imaging, DWI, and magnetization transfer sequences to quantify bone marrow fat, cellularity, and macromolecular components in a mouse model of myelofibrosis. We monitored spleen volume, the established imaging marker for treatment, with anatomic MRI. After confirming bone marrow disease by MRI, we randomized mice to treatment with an approved drug (ruxolitinib or fedratinib) or an investigational agent, navitoclax, for 33 days. We measured the effects of therapy over time with bone marrow and spleen MRI. Results: All treatments produced heterogeneous responses with improvements in bone marrow evident in subsets of individual mice in all treatment groups. Reductions in spleen volume commonly occurred without corresponding improvement in bone marrow. MRI revealed patterns associated with effective and ineffective responses to treatment in bone marrow and identified regional variations in efficacy within a bone. Conclusions: Quantitative MRI revealed modest, heterogeneous improvements in bone marrow disease when treating mice with established myelofibrosis. These results emphasize the value of bone marrow MRI to assess treatment in preclinical models and the potential to advance clinical trials for patients.","Magnetic Resonance Imaging, ",Primary Myelofibrosis        ,Bone Marrow        ,Not Applicable,Open Access,

We performed enhanced cross-linking immunoprecipitation, RNA sequencing and affinity purification-mass spectrometry to investigate a subset of candidates with no prior association with splicing. Integrative analysis of these assays indicates surprising roles for TRNAU1AP, SCAF8 and RTCA in the modulation of hundreds of endogenous splicing events. We also leveraged our tethering assays and top candidates to identify potent and compact exon inclusion activation domains for splicing modulation applications. Using these identified domains, we engineered programmable fusion proteins that outperform current artificial splicing factors at manipulating inclusion of reporter and endogenous exons.

This study aimed to gain a better understanding of the immune response behind the success of the vaccine in vivo, through use of ex vivo and in vivo assays. Here, we analyze the activation of various immune cells isolated from healthy mouse spleens and find that antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells (DCs) are being activated following 24 h incubation with 1:10 mg TNL/mg splenocytes. These cells were further explored to determine the pathway by which activation is occurring, and it was observed that TNL are phagocytosed by DCs to activate NF-kB and c-Fos pathways, resulting in enhanced cytokine release after 24 h.

TKIs can induce long-term remission but are also not curative. Thus, CML is an ideal system to test our hypothesis that transcriptome-based state-transition models accurately predict cancer evolution and treatment response. We collected time-sequential blood samples from tetracycline-off (Tet-Off) BCR::ABL-inducible transgenic mice and wild-type controls. From the transcriptome, we constructed a CML state-space and a three-well leukemogenic potential landscape. The potential's stable critical points defined observable disease states. Early states were characterized by anti-CML genes opposing leukemia; late states were characterized by pro-CML genes. Genes with expression patterns shaped similarly to the potential landscape were identified as drivers of disease transition. Re-introduction of tetracycline to silence the BCR::ABL gene returned diseased mice transcriptomes to a near healthy state, without reaching it, suggesting parts of the transition are irreversible. TKI only reverted the transcriptome to an intermediate disease state, without approaching a state of health; disease relapse occurred soon after treatment. Using only the earliest time-point as initial conditions, our state-transition models accurately predicted both disease progression and treatment response, supporting this as a potentially valuable approach to time clinical intervention, before phenotypic changes become detectable.","RNA Sequencing, Mathematical Modeling",Chronic Myeloid Leukemia         ,Blood,Not Applicable,Open Access,

While it is known that forces produced by individual contractile cells can stiffen the matrix, it remains unclear how simultaneous contraction of multiple cells in a fibrous matrix alters the stiffness at the scale of a cell. Here, we used computational modeling and experiments to quantify the stiffness of a random fibrous matrix embedded with multiple contracting inclusions, which mimicked the contractile forces of a cell. The results showed that when the matrix was free to contract as a result of the forces produced by the inclusions, the matrix softened rather than stiffened, which was surprising given that the contracting inclusions applied tensile forces to the matrix. Using the computational model, we identified that the underlying cause of the softening was that the majority of the fibers were under a local state of axial compression, causing buckling. We verified that this buckling-induced matrix softening was sufficient for cells to sense and respond by altering their morphology and force generation. Our findings reveal that the localized forces induced by cells do not always stiffen the matrix; rather, softening can occur in instances wherein the matrix can contract in response to the cell-generated forces. This study opens up new possibilities to investigate whether cell-induced softening contributes to maintenance of homeostatic conditions or progression of disease. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Mechanical interactions between cells and the surrounding matrix strongly influence cellular functions. Cell-induced forces can alter matrix properties, and much prior literature in this area focused on the influence of individual contracting cells. Cells in tissues are rarely solitary; rather, they are interspersed with neighboring cells throughout the matrix. As a result, the mechanics are complicated, leaving it unclear how the multiple contracting cells affect matrix stiffness. Here, we show that multiple contracting inclusions within a fibrous matrix can cause softening that in turn affects cell sensing and response. Our findings provide new directions to determine impacts of cell-induced softening on maintenance of tissue or progression of disease.",Computational Modeling,Breast Carcinoma,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access,

Targeted therapies have limited success in treating TNBC, thus a strategy enabling effective targeted combinations is an unmet need. To tackle these challenges and discover individualized targeted combination therapies for TNBC, we integrated phosphoproteomic analysis of altered signaling networks with patient-specific signaling signature (PaSSS) analysis using an information-theoretic, thermodynamic-based approach. Using this method on a large number of TNBC patient-derived tumors (PDX), we were able to thoroughly characterize each PDX by computing a patient-specific set of unbalanced signaling processes and assigning a personalized therapy based on them. We discovered that each tumor has an average of two separate processes, and that, consistent with prior research, EGFR is a major core target in at least one of them in half of the tumors analyzed. However, anti-EGFR monotherapies were predicted to be ineffective, thus we developed personalized combination treatments based on PaSSS. These were predicted to induce anti-EGFR responses or to be used to develop an alternative therapy if EGFR was not present.In-vivo experimental validation of the predicted therapy showed that PaSSS predictions were more accurate than other therapies. Thus, we suggest that a detailed identification of molecular imbalances is necessary to tailor therapy for each TNBC. In summary, we propose a new strategy to design personalized therapy for TNBC using pY proteomics and PaSSS analysis. This method can be applied to different cancer types to improve response to the biomarker-based treatment.","Patient Derived Xenograft, Computational Modeling",Triple-Negative Breast Carcinoma       ,Breast,Not Applicable,Open Access,

We assayed for intra- and interpatient drug response heterogeneity through testing of patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTOs). Methods: PDTOs were generated from CRS/HIPEC patients from December 2021 to September 2022 and subjected to an in vitro HIPEC drug screen. Drug response was assessed with a cell viability assay and cleaved caspase-3 staining. Results: A total of 31 patients were consented for tissue collection. Viable tissue was harvested from 23, and PDTO generation was successful in 13 (56%). PDTOs were analyzed from six appendiceal, three colorectal, two small bowel, one gastric, and one adrenal tumor. Drug screen results were generated in as few as 7 days (62%), with an average time of 12 days. Most patients received mitomycin-C (MMC) intraoperatively (n = 9); however, in only three cases was this agent considered the optimal choice in vitro. Three sets of PDTOs were resistant (defined as > 50% PDTO viability) to all agents tested and two were pan-sensitive (defined as 3 or more agents with < 50% PDTO viability). In three patients, organoids were generated from multiple metastatic sites and intrapatient drug response heterogeneity was observed. Conclusions: Both intra- and interpatient drug response heterogeneity exist in patients undergoing CRS/HIPEC for nongynecologic abdominal cancers.

In melanoma, whether cells in the microenvironment can endow such competence remains unclear. Using a combination of zebrafish transgenesis coupled with human tissues, we demonstrate that GABAergic signaling between keratinocytes and melanocytes promotes melanoma initiation by BRAFV600E. GABA is synthesized in melanoma cells, which then acts on GABA-A receptors in keratinocytes. Electron microscopy demonstrates specialized cell-cell junctions between keratinocytes and melanoma cells, and multielectrode array analysis shows that GABA acts to inhibit electrical activity in melanoma/keratinocyte cocultures. Genetic and pharmacologic perturbation of GABA synthesis abrogates melanoma initiation in vivo. These data suggest that GABAergic signaling across the skin microenvironment regulates the ability of oncogenes to initiate melanoma. Significance: This study shows evidence of GABA-mediated regulation of electrical activity between melanoma cells and keratinocytes, providing a new mechanism by which the microenvironment promotes tumor initiation.

Across many cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a high stroma/tumor ratio correlates with poor survival. In many contexts, this correlation can be explained by the direct reduction of therapy sensitivity induced by stroma-produced paracrine factors. We sought to explore whether this direct effect contributes to the link between stroma and poor responses to chemotherapies. In vitro studies with panels of TNBC cell line models and stromal isolates failed to detect a direct modulation of chemoresistance. At the same time, consistent with prior studies, fibroblast-produced secreted factors stimulated treatment-independent enhancement of tumor cell proliferation. Spatial analyses indicated that proximity to stroma is often associated with enhanced tumor cell proliferation in vivo. These observations suggested an indirect link between stroma and chemoresistance, where stroma-augmented proliferation potentiates the recovery of residual tumors between chemotherapy cycles. To evaluate this hypothesis, a spatial agent-based model of stroma impact on proliferation/death dynamics was developed that was quantitatively parameterized using inferences from histologic analyses and experimental studies. The model demonstrated that the observed enhancement of tumor cell proliferation within stroma-proximal niches could enable tumors to avoid elimination over multiple chemotherapy cycles. Therefore, this study supports the existence of an indirect mechanism of environment-mediated chemoresistance that might contribute to the negative correlation between stromal content and poor therapy outcomes. Significance: Integration of experimental research with mathematical modeling reveals an indirect microenvironmental chemoresistance mechanism by which stromal cells stimulate breast cancer cell proliferation and highlights the importance of consideration of proliferation/death dynamics.

Immunosuppression by myeloid cells in both the tumor microenvironment and systemic circulation are believed to contribute to this treatment resistance.

Lymphocyte concentration changes have been reported in patients with glioblastoma; however, monocytes are likely a key cell type contributing to immunosuppression in glioblastoma. Peripheral monocyte concentration changes in patients receiving commonly employed radiation fractionation schemes are unknown.

Here, we dissect the impact of this genotype on melanoma tumor growth kinetics, tumor phenotype, and response to treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) or targeted therapy. Methods: The KDR genotype was determined and the associations between the KDR Q472H variant (KDR-Var), angiogenesis, tumor immunophenotype, and response to MAPK inhibition or ICI treatment were examined. Melanoma B16 cell lines were transfected with KDR-Var or KDR wild type (KDR-WT), and the differences in tumor kinetics were evaluated. We also examined the impact of KDR-Var on the response of melanoma cells to a combination of VEGFR inhibition with MAPKi. Results: We identified the KDR-Var genotype in 81/489 (37%) patients, and it was associated with a more angiogenic (<i>p</i> = 0.003) and immune-suppressive tumor phenotype. KDR-Var was also associated with decreased PFS to MAPKi (<i>p</i> = 0.022) and a trend with worse PFS to anti-PD1 therapy (<i>p</i> = 0.06). KDR-Var B16 murine models had increased average tumor volume (<i>p</i> = 0.0027) and decreased CD45 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (<i>p</i> = 0.0282).

Cancer cells compromise the metabolic fitness of CD8+ T cells within the TME, but the mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that one-carbon (1C) metabolism is enhanced in T cells in an antigen-specific manner. Therapeutic supplementation of 1C metabolism using formate enhances CD8+ T-cell fitness and antitumor efficacy of PD-1 blockade in B16-OVA tumors. Formate supplementation drives transcriptional alterations in CD8+ T-cell metabolism and increases gene signatures for cellular proliferation and activation. Combined formate and anti-PD-1 therapy increases tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells, which are essential for enhanced tumor control. Our data demonstrate that formate provides metabolic support to CD8+ T cells reinvigorated by anti-PD-1 to overcome a metabolic vulnerability in 1C metabolism in the TME to further improve T-cell function. Significance: This study identifies that deficiencies in 1C metabolism limit the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in B16-OVA tumors. Supplementing 1C metabolism with formate during anti-PD-1 therapy enhances CD8+ T-cell fitness in the TME and CD8+ T-cell-mediated tumor clearance. These findings demonstrate that formate supplementation can enhance exhausted CD8+ T-cell function. See related commentary by Lin et al., p. 2507.

Here we use a live-cell ""ChReporter"" method to identify cells with a single chromosomal loss in efforts to better understand differences in cell shape, motility, and growth. We focus on a standard cancer line and first show clonal populations that retain the ChReporter exhibit large differences in cell and nuclear morphology as well as motility. Phenotype metrics follow simple rules, including migratory persistence scaling with speed, and cytoskeletal differences are evident from drug responses, imaging, and single-cell RNA sequencing. However, mechanotype-genotype relationships between fluorescent ChReporter-positive clones proved complex and motivated comparisons of clones that differ only in loss or retention of a Chromosome-5 ChReporter. When lost, fluorescence-null cells show low expression of Chromosome-5 genes, including a key tumor suppressor <i>APC</i> that regulates microtubules and proliferation. Colonies are compact, nuclei are rounded, and cells proliferate more, with drug results implicating APC, and patient survival data indicating an association in multiple tumor-types. Visual identification of genotype with ChReporters can thus help clarify mechanotype and mechano-evolution.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,

While it is well-established that intraluminal lymphatic valves in the collecting LVs prevent fluid backflow (secondary lymphatic valves), a separate valve system in the initial LVs that only permits interstitial fluid influx into the LVs, preventing fluid leakage back to the interstitium (primary lymphatic valves), remains incompletely understood. Although lymphatic dysfunction is commonly observed in inflammation and autoimmune diseases, how the primary lymphatic valves are affected by acute and chronic inflammation has scarcely been explored and even less so using <i>in vitro</i> lymphatic models. Here, we developed a human initial lymphatic vessel chip where interstitial fluid pressure and luminal fluid pressure are controlled to examine primary lymph valve function. In normal conditions, lymphatic drainage (fluid uptake) and permeability (fluid leakage) in engineered LVs were maintained high and low, respectively, which was consistent with our understanding of healthy primary lymph valves. Next, we examined the effects of acute and chronic inflammation. Under the acute inflammation condition with a TNF-α treatment (2 hours), degradation of fibrillin and impeded lymphatic drainage were observed, which were reversed by treatment with anti-inflammatory dexamethasone. Surprisingly, the chronic inflammation condition (repeated TNF-α treatments during 48 hours) deposited fibrillin to compensate for the fibrillin loss, showing no change in lymphatic drainage. Instead, the chronic inflammation condition led to cell death and disruption of lymphatic endothelial cell-cell junctions, increasing lymphatic permeability and fluid leakage. Our human lymphatic model shows two distinct mechanisms by which primary lymphatic valve dysfunction occurs in acute and chronic inflammation.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,

Disruption of protein expression can suppress targets and enable therapeutic intervention. To this end, we developed a drug discovery workflow that incorporates cell-line-selective screening and high-throughput expression profiling followed by regulatory network analysis to identify compounds that suppress regulatory drivers of disease. Applying this approach to neuroblastoma (NBL), we screened bioactive molecules in cell lines representing its MYC-dependent (MYCNA) and mesenchymal (MES) subtypes to identify selective compounds, followed by PLATESeq profiling of treated cells. This revealed compounds that disrupt a sub-network of MYCNA-specific regulatory proteins, resulting in MYCN degradation in vivo.

New data indicate that AR is expressed in additional cell types within the tumor microenvironment.

A decrease in lamin levels and/or lamin mutations are associated with a host of human diseases. Despite being only about 15 nm thick, perturbation of components of the nuclear lamina dramatically impacts the deformation response of the entire nucleus through mechanisms that are not well understood. Here we discuss evidence for the recently proposed 'nuclear drop' model that explains the role of A-type lamins in nuclear deformation in migrating cells. In this model, the nuclear lamina acts as an inextensible surface, supporting a surface tension when fully unfolded, that balances nuclear interior pressure. Much like a liquid drop surface where the molecularly thin interface governs surface tension and drop shape under external forces, the thin nuclear lamina imparts a surface tension on the nuclear drop to resist nuclear deformation as well as to establish nuclear shape. We discuss implications of the nuclear drop model for the function of this crucially important eukaryotic organelle.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,,Restricted Access,

However, factors contributing to the varied treatment response and the optimal definition of hyperdiploidy remain uncertain. Methods: We analyzed outcomes of patients treated on two consecutive frontline ALL protocols, using six different definitions of hyperdiploidy: chromosome number 51-67 (Chr51-67); DNA index (DI; DI1.16-1.6); United Kingdom ALL study group low-risk hyperdiploid, either trisomy of chromosomes 17 and 18 or +17 or +18 in the absence of +5 and +20; single trisomy of chromosome 18; double trisomy of chromosomes 4 and 10; and triple trisomy (TT) of chromosomes 4, 10, and 17.

We present a pilot study in which abiraterone dosing is guided by evolution-informed mathematical models to delay onset of resistance. Methods: In the study cohort, abiraterone was stopped when PSA was <50% of pretreatment value and resumed when PSA returned to baseline. Results are compared to a contemporaneous cohort who had >50% PSA decline after initial abiraterone administration and met trial eligibility requirements but chose standard of care (SOC) dosing. Results: 17 subjects were enrolled in the adaptive therapy group and 16 in the SOC group. All SOC subjects have progressed, but four patients in the study cohort remain stably cycling (range 53-70 months).

On average, study subjects received no abiraterone during 46% of time on trial. Longitudinal trial data demonstrated the competition coefficient ratio (<i>α<sub>RS</sub>/α<sub>SR</sub></i>) of sensitive and resistant populations, a critical factor in intratumoral evolution, was two- to threefold higher than pre-trial estimates. Computer simulations of intratumoral evolutionary dynamics in the four long-term survivors found that, due to the larger value for <i>α<sub>RS</sub>/α<sub>SR,</sub></i> cycled therapy significantly decreased the resistant population. Simulations in subjects who progressed predicted further increases in OS could be achieved with prompt abiraterone withdrawal after achieving 50% PSA reduction. Conclusions: Incorporation of evolution-based mathematical models into abiraterone monotherapy for mCRPC significantly increases TTP and OS. Computer simulations with updated parameters from longitudinal trial data can estimate intratumoral evolutionary dynamics in each subject and identify strategies to improve outcomes.

Historically, cancer research has focused on observed genetic mutations in the dominant tumor cell populations which presumably increase fitness. Negative selection, i.e., removal of deleterious mutations from a population, is not observable but can provide critical information regarding genes involved in essential cellular processes. Similar to immunoediting, ""evolutionary triage"" eliminates mutations in tumor cells that increase susceptibility to the host immune response while mutations that shield them from immune attack increase proliferation and are readily observable (e.g., B2M mutations). These dynamics permit an ""inverse problem"" analysis linking the fitness consequences of a mutation to its prevalence in a tumor cohort. This is evident in ""driver mutations"" but, equally important, can identify essential genes in which mutations are seen significantly less than expected by chance.

A common intratumoral evolutionary pathway, probably initiated as adaptation to hypoxia, leads to the ""Warburg phenotype"" which maintains high glycolytic rates and acid production, even in normoxic conditions. Since individual cancer cells are the unit of Darwinian selection, intraspecific competition dominates intratumoral evolution. Thus, elements of the Warburg phenotype become key ""strategies"" in competition with cancer cell populations that retain the metabolism of the parental normal cells. Here we model the complex interactions of cell populations with Warburg and parental phenotypes as they compete for access to vasculature, while subject to direct interference by Warburg-related acidosis. In this competitive environment, vasculature delivers nutrients, removes acid and necrotic detritus, and responds to signaling molecules (VEGF and TNF-α). The model is built in a nested fashion and growth parameters are derived from monolayer, spheroid, and xenograft experiments on prostate cancer. The resulting model of in vivo tumor growth reaches a steady state, displaying linear growth and coexistence of both glycolytic and parental phenotypes consistent with experimental observations. The model predicts that increasing tumor pH sufficiently early can arrest the development of the glycolytic phenotype, while decreasing tumor pH accelerates this evolution and increases VEGF production.

Results: The evolved SCID mice suppressed tumour growth through biomechanical restriction from increased mesenchymal proliferation, and the evolved Black/6 mice suppressed tumour growth by increasing immune-mediated killing of cancer cells. However, transcriptomic changes of multicellular tissue organisation and function genes allowed LL/2-Luc-M38 cells to adapt through increased matrix remodelling in SCID mice, and reduced angiogenesis, increased energy utilisation and accelerated proliferation in Black/6 mice.

Here, we propose an alternative model in which the initial genetic state of a cancer cell is the result of mutations that occurred throughout the lifetime of the host. However, these mutations are not carcinogenic because normal cells in multicellular organism cannot ordinarily evolve. That is, proliferation and death of normal cells are controlled by local tissue constraints typically governed by nongenomic information dynamics in the cell membrane. As a result, the cells of a multicellular organism have a fitness that is identical to the host, which is then the unit of natural selection. Somatic evolution of a cell can occur only when its fate becomes independent of host constraints. Now, survival, proliferation, and death of individual cells are dependent on Darwinian dynamics. This cellular transition from host-defined fitness to self-defined fitness may, consistent with the conventional view of carcinogenesis, result from mutations that render the cell insensitive to host controls. However, an identical state will result when surrounding tissue cannot exert control because of injury, inflammation, aging, or infection. Here, all surviving cells within the site of tissue damage default to self-defined fitness functions allowing them to evolve so that the mutations accumulated over the lifetime of the host now serve as the genetic heritage of an evolutionary unit of selection. Furthermore, tissue injury generates a new ecology cytokines and growth factors that might promote proliferation in cells with prior receptor mutations.

This disease is uniformly fatal, with intratumor heterogeneity the major reason for treatment failure and recurrence. Just like the nature vs nurture debate, heterogeneity can arise from intrinsic or environmental influences. Whilst it is impossible to clinically separate observed behavior of cells from their environmental context, using a mathematical framework combined with multiscale data gives us insight into the relative roles of variation from different sources. To better understand the implications of intratumor heterogeneity on therapeutic outcomes, we created a hybrid agent-based mathematical model that captures both the overall tumor kinetics and the individual cellular behavior. We track single cells as agents, cell density on a coarser scale, and growth factor diffusion and dynamics on a finer scale over time and space. Our model parameters were fit utilizing serial MRI imaging and cell tracking data from ex vivo tissue slices acquired from a growth-factor driven glioblastoma murine model. When fitting our model to serial imaging only, there was a spectrum of equally-good parameter fits corresponding to a wide range of phenotypic behaviors. When fitting our model using imaging and cell scale data, we determined that environmental heterogeneity alone is insufficient to match the single cell data, and intrinsic heterogeneity is required to fully capture the migration behavior. The wide spectrum of in silico tumors also had a wide variety of responses to an application of an anti-proliferative treatment. Recurrent tumors were generally less proliferative than pre-treatment tumors as measured via the model simulations and validated from human GBM patient histology. Further, we found that all tumors continued to grow with an anti-migratory treatment alone, but the anti-proliferative/anti-migratory combination generally showed improvement over an anti-proliferative treatment alone.

Cancer cells, through their access to the vast information of the human genome, have a remarkable capacity to deploy adaptive strategies for even the most effective treatments. We note there are two critical steps in the clinical manifestation of treatment resistance. The first, which is widely investigated, requires molecular machinery necessary to eliminate the cytotoxic effect of the treatment. However, the emergence of a resistant phenotype is not in itself clinically significant. That is, resistant cells affect patient outcomes only when they succeed in the second step of resistance by proliferating into a sufficiently large population to allow tumor progression and treatment failure. Importantly, proliferation of the resistant phenotype is by no means certain and, in fact, depends on complex Darwinian dynamics governed by the costs and benefits of the resistance mechanisms in the context of the local environment and competing populations. Attempts to target the molecular machinery of resistance have had little clinical success largely because of the diversity within the human genome-therapeutic interruption of one mechanism simply results in its replacement by an alternative. Here we explore evolutionarily informed strategies (adaptive, double-bind, and extinction therapies) for overcoming treatment resistance that seek to understand and exploit the critical evolutionary dynamics that govern proliferation of the resistant phenotypes.

Here, we investigate the evolutionary dynamics of Anthropocene species extinctions as an alternative model for curative cancer therapy. Human activities can produce extinctions of large, diverse, and geographically distributed populations. The extinction of a species typically follows a pattern in which initial demographic and ecological insults reduce the size and heterogeneity of the population. The surviving individuals, with decreased genetic diversity and often fragmented ecology, are then vulnerable to small stochastic perturbations that further reduce the population until extinction is inevitable. We hypothesize large, diverse, and disseminated cancer populations can be eradicated using similar evolutionary dynamics. Initial therapy is applied to reduce population size and diversity and followed by new treatments to exploit the eco-evolutionary vulnerability of small and/or declining populations. Mathematical models and computer simulations demonstrate initial reductive treatment followed immediately by demographic and ecological perturbations, similar to the empirically derived treatment of pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia, can consistently achieve curative outcomes in nonpediatric cancers.

These models are usually defined on the basis of population-scale phenomenological assumptions and cannot capture adaptive phenomena that are driven by stochastic variability in the evolutionary paths of single individuals. In light of these considerations, in this paper we develop a stochastic individual-based model for the coevolution of two competing phenotype-structured cell populations that are exposed to time-varying nutrient levels and undergo spontaneous, heritable phenotypic changes with different probabilities. Here, the evolution of every cell is described by a set of rules that result in a discrete-time branching random walk on the space of phenotypic states, and nutrient levels are governed by a difference equation in which a sink term models nutrient consumption by the cells. We formally show that the deterministic continuum counterpart of this model comprises a system of nonlocal partial differential equations for the cell population density functions coupled with an ordinary differential equation for the nutrient concentration. We compare the individual-based model and its continuum analog, focusing on scenarios whereby the predictions of the two models differ. The results obtained clarify the conditions under which significant differences between the two models can emerge due to bottleneck effects that bring about both lower regularity of the density functions of the two populations and more pronounced demographic stochasticity. In particular, bottleneck effects emerge in the presence of lower probabilities of phenotypic variation and are more apparent when the two populations are characterized by lower fitness initial mean phenotypes and smaller initial levels of phenotypic heterogeneity. The emergence of these effects, and thus the agreement between the two modeling approaches, is also dependent on the initial proportions of the two populations.
