One example is the recognition that patients with IDH-wildtype diffuse astrocytic gliomas demonstrating lower-grade histologic features but genomic and/or epigenomic profile characteristic of glioblastoma typically have poor outcomes similar to patients with histologically diagnosed glioblastoma. Here we sought to determine the clinical impact of prospective genomic profiling for these IDH-wildtype diffuse astrocytic gliomas lacking high-grade histologic features but with molecular profile of glioblastoma. Methods: Clinical management and outcomes were analyzed for 38 consecutive adult patients with IDH-wildtype diffuse astrocytic gliomas lacking necrosis or microvascular proliferation on histologic examination that were genomically profiled on a prospective clinical basis revealing criteria for an integrated diagnosis of ""diffuse astrocytic glioma, IDH-wildtype, with molecular features of glioblastoma, WHO grade IV"" per cIMPACT-NOW criteria. Results: We identified that this diagnosis consists of two divergent clinical scenarios based on integration of radiologic, histologic, and genomic features that we term ""early/evolving"" and ""undersampled"" glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype. We found that prospective genomically guided identification of early/evolving and undersampled IDH-wildtype glioblastoma resulted in more aggressive patient management and improved clinical outcomes compared to a biologically matched historical control patient cohort receiving standard-of-care therapy based on histomorphologic diagnosis alone. Conclusions: These results support routine use of genomic and/or epigenomic profiling to accurately classify glial neoplasms, as these assays not only improve diagnostic classification but critically lead to more appropriate patient management that can improve clinical outcomes.","Next Generation Sequencing, Imaging, Statistical Modeling",Glioblastoma,Brain,Not Applicable,Open Access

The present study aimed to identify the patient, treatment, and imaging features, including measures of sarcopenia, associated with worse survival and 90-day postoperative mortality for elderly patients with GBM. Methods: A single-center retrospective study was conducted of patients aged ≥79 years at surgery who had undergone biopsy or resection of a World Health Organization grade IV GBM at the initial diagnosis. Imaging features of sarcopenia were collected, including the masseter and temporalis muscle diameters. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors associated with survival and 30-day complications. Results: The cohort included 110 patients with a mean age of 82.8 years at surgery and a median preoperative Karnofsky performance scale score of 80. The majority of patients underwent a surgical resection (66.4%) while a minority underwent biopsy (33.6%). Adjuvant chemo- and/or radiation therapy were used in 72.5% of the cohort. On multivariate analysis, age (hazard ratio [HR], 7.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.63-36.3), adjuvant therapy (RT or TMZ vs. none: HR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.05-0.3; RT plus TMZ vs. none: HR, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.02-0.14), surgical resection (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.24-0.9), multifocality (HR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.14-6.4), and masseter diameter (HR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.02-0.78) were associated with survival. Masseter diameter was the only factor associated with 90-day mortality after surgical resection (P = 0.044). Conclusions: GBM patients over the age of 79 have acceptable outcomes after resection, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and RT. In addition to the treatment factors that predicted for survival, a decreased masseter diameter on preoperative imaging, a marker of sarcopenia, was associated with shorter overall survival and 90-day mortality after surgical resection.",Clinical Study,Glioblastoma,Brain,Not Applicable,Open Access

Pathologists deal with issues related to tumor heterogeneity since analyzing a single sample does not necessarily capture a representative depiction of cancer, and a tissue biopsy usually only presents a small fraction of the tumor. Many multiplex tissue imaging platforms (MTIs) make the assumption that tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing small core samples of 2-dimensional (2D) tissue sections are a good approximation of bulk tumors although tumors are not 2D. However, emerging whole slide imaging (WSI) or 3D tumor atlases that use MTIs like cyclic immunofluorescence (CyCIF) strongly challenge this assumption. In spite of the additional insight gathered by measuring the tumor microenvironment in WSI or 3D, it can be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to process tens or hundreds of tissue sections with CyCIF. Even when resources are not limited, the criteria for region of interest (ROI) selection in tissues for downstream analysis remain largely qualitative and subjective as stratified sampling requires the knowledge of objects and evaluates their features. Despite the fact TMAs fail to adequately approximate whole tissue features, a theoretical subsampling of tissue exists that can best represent the tumor in the whole slide image. <b>Methods:</b> To address these challenges, we propose deep learning approaches to learn multi-modal image translation tasks from two aspects: 1) generative modeling approach to reconstruct 3D CyCIF representation and 2) co-embedding CyCIF image and Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) section to learn multi-modal mappings by a cross-domain translation for minimum representative ROI selection. <b>Results and discussion:</b> We demonstrate that generative modeling enables a 3D virtual CyCIF reconstruction of a colorectal cancer specimen given a small subset of the imaging data at training time. By co-embedding histology and MTI features, we propose a simple convex optimization for objective ROI selection. We demonstrate the potential application of ROI selection and the efficiency of its performance with respect to cellular heterogeneity.","Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method, Cyclic Immunofluorescence, Computational Modeling, Mathematical Modeling",Colorectal Neoplasm       ,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access

It has been increasingly used for single-cell-based spatial phenotyping in a wide range of samples. However, it only acquires a rectangle field of view (FOV) with a relatively small size and low image resolution, which hinders downstream analysis. Here, we reported a highly practical dual-modality imaging method that combines high-resolution immunofluorescence (IF) and high-dimensional IMC on the same tissue slide. Our computational pipeline uses the whole-slide image (WSI) of IF as a spatial reference and integrates small-FOV IMC into a WSI of IMC. The high-resolution IF images enable accurate single-cell segmentation to extract robust high-dimensional IMC features for downstream analysis.

To identify effective therapeutic targets, we sought to identify molecular pathways that drive metastasis and HNC progression, through large-scale systematic analyses of transcriptomic data. Methods: We performed meta-analysis across 29 gene expression studies including 2074 primary HNC biopsies to identify genes and transcriptional pathways associated with survival and lymph node metastasis (LNM). To understand the biological roles of these genes in HNC, we identified their associated cancer pathways, as well as the cell types that express them within HNC tumor microenvironments, by integrating single-cell RNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq from sorted cell populations. Results: Patient survival-associated genes were heterogenous and included drivers of diverse tumor biological processes: these included tumor-intrinsic processes such as epithelial dedifferentiation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition, as well as tumor microenvironmental factors such as T cell-mediated immunity and cancer-associated fibroblast activity. Unexpectedly, LNM-associated genes were almost universally associated with epithelial dedifferentiation within malignant cells. Genes negatively associated with LNM consisted of regulators of squamous epithelial differentiation that are expressed within well-differentiated malignant cells, while those positively associated with LNM represented cell cycle regulators that are normally repressed by the p53-DREAM pathway. These pro-LNM genes are overexpressed in proliferating malignant cells of TP53 mutated and HPV + ve HNCs and are strongly associated with stemness, suggesting that they represent markers of pre-metastatic cancer stem-like cells. LNM-associated genes are deregulated in high-grade oral precancerous lesions, and deregulated further in primary HNCs with advancing tumor grade and deregulated further still in lymph node metastases. Conclusions: In HNC, patient survival is affected by multiple biological processes and is strongly influenced by the tumor immune and stromal microenvironments. In contrast, LNM appears to be driven primarily by malignant cell plasticity, characterized by epithelial dedifferentiation coupled with EMT-independent proliferation and stemness. Our findings postulate that LNM is initially caused by loss of p53-DREAM-mediated repression of cell cycle genes during early tumorigenesis.","Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting, Flow Cytometry, RNA Sequencing, Single Cell RNA-Sequencing",Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma,Head and Neck,Not Applicable,Open Access

These spheroids may form through single cells that detach and aggregate (Sph-SC) or through collective detachment (Sph-CD). We developed an <i>in vitro</i> model to generate and separate Sph-SC from Sph-CD to enable study of Sph-CD in disease progression. <i>In vitro</i>-generated Sph-CD and spheroids isolated from ascites were similar in size (mean diameter 51 vs 55 <i>μ</i>m, p > 0.05) and incorporated multiple ECM proteins. Using the <i>in vitro</i> model, nascent protein labeling, and qRT-PCR, we determined that ECM was produced after detachment. As fibronectin plays a key role in many cell adhesion events, we confirmed that inhibiting RGD-based adhesion or fibronectin assembly reduced Sph-CD-mesothelial adhesion strength under shear stress. Our model will enable future studies to determine factors that favor formation of Sph-CD, as well as allow investigators to manipulate Sph-CD to better study their effects on HGSOC progression.","Immunohistochemistry Staining Method, RT-qPCR, Modeling",High Grade Ovarian Serous Adenocarcinoma,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access

Transcription factor (TF) networks have been the focus of studies to identify SCLC subtype regulators via systems approaches. Yet, their structures, which can provide clues on subtype drivers and transitions, are barely investigated. Here, we analyze the structure of an SCLC TF network by using graph theory concepts and identify its structurally important components responsible for complex signal processing, called hubs. We show that the hubs of the network are regulators of different SCLC subtypes by analyzing first the unbiased network structure and then integrating RNA-seq data as weights assigned to each interaction. Data-driven analysis emphasizes MYC as a hub, consistent with recent reports. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the pathways connecting functionally distinct hubs may control subtype transitions and test this hypothesis via network simulations on a candidate pathway and observe subtype transition. Overall, structural analyses of complex networks can identify their functionally important components and pathways driving the network dynamics. Such analyses can be an initial step for generating hypotheses and can guide the discovery of target pathways whose perturbation may change the network dynamics phenotypically.","Computational Modeling, Mathematical Modeling",Lung Small Cell Carcinoma,Lung,Not Applicable,Open Access

We previously conducted a phase I trial of cabiralizumab (anti-CSF1R), sotigalimab (CD40-agonist) and nivolumab. Our current purpose was to study the activity and cellular effects of this three-drug regimen in anti-PD-1-resistant melanoma. Methods: We employed a Simon's two-stage design and analyzed circulating immune cells from patients treated with this regimen for treatment-related changes. We assessed various dose levels of anti-CSF1R in murine melanoma models and studied the cellular and molecular effects. Results: Thirteen patients were enrolled in the first stage. We observed one (7.7%) confirmed and one (7.7%) unconfirmed partial response, 5 patients had stable disease (38.5%) and 6 disease progression (42.6%). We elected not to proceed to the second stage. CyTOF analysis revealed a reduction in non-classical monocytes. Patients with prolonged stable disease or partial response who remained on study for longer had increased markers of antigen presentation after treatment compared to patients whose disease progressed rapidly. In a murine model, higher anti-CSF1R doses resulted in increased tumor growth and worse survival. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we identified a suppressive monocyte/macrophage population in murine tumors exposed to higher doses. Conclusions: Higher anti-CSF1R doses are inferior to lower doses in a preclinical model, inducing a suppressive macrophage population, and potentially explaining the disappointing results observed in patients. While it is impossible to directly infer human doses from murine studies, careful intra-species evaluation can provide important insight.

These effects may be related to suppressed innate and adaptive immunity, decreased immunosurveillance, and disrupted cellular signaling. We hypothesized that anesthetics would promote lung tumor growth via altered immune function in a murine model and tested this using an immunological control group of immunodeficient mice. Methods: Lewis lung carcinoma cells were injected via tail vein into C57BL/6 immunocompetent and NSG immunodeficient mice during exposure to isoflurane and ketamine versus controls without anesthesia. Mice were imaged on days 0, 3, 10, and 14 post-tumor cell injection. On day 14, mice were euthanized and organs fixed for metastasis quantification and immunohistochemistry staining. We compared growth of tumors measured from bioluminescent imaging and tumor metastasis in ex vivo bioluminescent imaging of lung and liver. Results: Metastases were significantly greater for immunocompromised NSG mice than immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice over the 14-day experiment (partial η2 = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.54, 0.76). Among immunocompetent mice, metastases were greatest for mice receiving ketamine, intermediate for those receiving isoflurane, and least for control mice (partial η2 = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.82, 0.91). In immunocompetent mice, significantly decreased T lymphocyte (partial η2 = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.29, 0.93) and monocyte (partial η2 = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.52, 0.96) infiltration was observed in anesthetic-treated mice versus controls.

Nuclear shapes result from deformations of the sub-nuclear components-nuclear lamina and chromatin. How these structures respond to cytoskeletal forces to form the nuclear shape remains unresolved. Although the mechanisms regulating nuclear shape in human tissues are not fully understood, it is known that different nuclear shapes arise from cumulative nuclear deformations post-mitosis, ranging from the rounded morphologies that develop immediately after mitosis to the various nuclear shapes that roughly correspond to cell shape (<i>e.g.,</i> elongated nuclei in elongated cells, flat nuclei in flat cells). <b>Methods:</b> We formulated a mathematical model to predict nuclear shapes of cells in various contexts under the geometric constraints of fixed cell volume, nuclear volume and lamina surface area. Nuclear shapes were predicted and compared to experiments for cells in various geometries, including isolated on a flat surface, on patterned rectangles and lines, within a monolayer, isolated in a well, or when the nucleus is impinging against a slender obstacle. <b>Results and Discussion:</b> The close agreement between predicted and experimental shapes demonstrates a simple geometric principle of nuclear shaping: the excess surface area of the nuclear lamina (relative to that of a sphere of the same volume) permits a wide range of highly deformed nuclear shapes under the constraints of constant surface area and constant volume. When the lamina is smooth (tensed), the nuclear shape can be predicted entirely from these geometric constraints alone for a given cell shape. This principle explains why flattened nuclear shapes in fully spread cells are insensitive to the magnitude of the cytoskeletal forces. Also, the surface tension in the nuclear lamina and nuclear pressure can be estimated from the predicted cell and nuclear shapes when the cell cortical tension is known, and the predictions are consistent with measured forces. These results show that excess surface area of the nuclear lamina is the key determinant of nuclear shapes. When the lamina is smooth (tensed), the nuclear shape can be determined purely by the geometric constraints of constant (but excess) nuclear surface area, nuclear volume, and cell volume, for a given cell adhesion footprint, independent of the magnitude of the cytoskeletal forces involved.",Mathematical Modeling,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access

Here, we report that pulmonary lymphatic vessels, which traffic neutrophils and other immune cells to the lung-draining lymph node (LDLN), can also be blocked by fibrin clots in severe COVID-19. Immunostained tissue sections from COVID-19 decedents revealed widespread lymphatic clotting not only in the lung but also in the LDLN, where the extent of clotting correlated with the presence of abnormal, regressed, or missing germinal centers (GCs). It strongly correlated with the presence of intralymphatic NETs. In mice, tumor necrosis factor α induced intralymphatic fibrin clots; this could be inhibited by DNase I, which degrades NETs. In vitro, TNF-α induced lymphatic endothelial cell upregulation of ICAM-1 and CXCL8, among other neutrophil-recruiting factors, as well as thrombomodulin downregulation; in decedents, lymphatic clotting in LDLNs. In a separate cohort of hospitalized patients, serum levels of Myeloperoxidase-DNA (MPO-DNA, a NET marker) inversely correlated with antiviral antibody titers, but D-dimer levels, indicative of blood thrombosis, did not correlate with either. Patients with high MPO-DNA but low D-dimer levels generated poor antiviral antibody titers. This study introduces lymphatic coagulation in lungs and LDLNs as a clinical manifestation of severe COVID-19 and suggests the involvement of NETosis of lymphatic-trafficking neutrophils. It further suggests that lymphatic clotting may correlate with impaired formation or maintenance of GCs necessary for robust antiviral antibody responses, although further studies are needed to determine whether and how lymphatic coagulation affects adaptive immune responses.","Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method, Immunofluorescent Staining Method",Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Open Access

Whether β-arrestins act independently of G protein-mediated signaling has not been fully elucidated. Studies using genome-editing approaches revealed that whereas G proteins are essential for mitogen-activated protein kinase activation by GPCRs., β-arrestins play a more prominent role in signal compartmentalization. However, in the absence of G proteins, GPCRs may not activate β-arrestins, thereby limiting the ability to distinguish G protein from β-arrestin-mediated signaling events.

We found that Gα<sub>s</sub> is not required for β2AR and β-arrestin conformational changes, β-arrestin recruitment, and receptor internalization, but that Gα<sub>s</sub> dictates the GPCR kinase isoforms involved in β-arrestin recruitment. By RNA-Seq analysis, we found that protein kinase A and mitogen-activated protein kinase gene signatures were activated by stimulation of β2AR in wildtype and β-arrestin1/2-KO cells but absent in Gα<sub>s</sub>-KO cells. These results were validated by re-expressing Gα<sub>s</sub> in the corresponding KO cells and silencing β-arrestins in wildtype cells. These findings were extended to cellular systems expressing endogenous levels of β2AR.

Of the existing strategies, DNA points accumulation in imaging nanoscale topography (DNA-PAINT) affords convenient multiplexing, an important feature in interrogating complex biological systems. A practical limitation of DNA-PAINT, however, has been the slow imaging speed. In its original form, DNA-PAINT imaging of each target takes tens of minutes to hours to complete. To address this challenge, several improved implementations have been introduced. These include DNA-PAINT-ERS (where E = ethylene carbonate; R = repeat sequence; S = spacer), a set of strategies that leads to both accelerated DNA-PAINT imaging speed and improved image quality.

We then developed 3D scaffolds with μ-compressive moduli resembling either stiffer tumor core or softer peritumoral brain tissue. We demonstrate that the softer matrix microenvironment induces a shift in GBM cell metabolism toward glycolysis, which manifests in lower proliferation rate and increased migration activities. Finally, we show that these mechanical cues are transduced from the matrix via CD44 and integrin receptors to induce metabolic and phenotypic changes in cancer cells.",Tissue Engineering,Glioblastoma,Brain,GSE239610,Open Access

Metabolomics and lipidomics revealed elevations in the redox buffers cystathionine, hexosylceramides, and glucosyl ceramides in the invasive front of both hydrogel-cultured tumors and patient site-directed biopsies, with immunofluorescence indicating elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) markers in invasive cells. Transcriptomics confirmed upregulation of ROS-producing and response genes at the invasive front in both hydrogel models and patient tumors. Amongst oncologic ROS, H2O2 specifically promoted glioblastoma invasion in 3D hydrogel spheroid cultures. A CRISPR metabolic gene screen revealed cystathionine gamma-lyase (CTH), which converts cystathionine to the non-essential amino acid cysteine in the transsulfuration pathway, to be essential for glioblastoma invasion. Correspondingly, supplementing CTH knockdown cells with exogenous cysteine rescued invasion. Pharmacologic CTH inhibition suppressed glioblastoma invasion, while CTH knockdown slowed glioblastoma invasion in vivo.

Here, we present a perfusable, multi-compartmental model that recapitulates the three microvascular compartments to assess various physiological properties such as vessel permeability, vasoconstriction dynamics, and circulating cell arrest and extravasation. Viscous finger patterning and passive pumping create the larger arterial and venular lumens, while the smaller diameter capillary bed vessels are generated through self-assembly. These compartments anastomose and form a perfusable, hierarchical system that portrays the directionality of blood flow through the microvasculature. The addition of collagen channels reduces the apparent permeability of the central capillary region, likely by reducing leakage from the side channels, enabling more accurate measurements of vascular permeability-an important motivation for this study. Furthermore, the model permits modulation of fluid flow and shear stress conditions throughout the system by using hydrostatic pressure heads to apply pressure differentials across either the arteriole or the capillary. This is a pertinent system for modeling circulating tumor or T cell dissemination and extravasation. Circulating cells were found to arrest in areas conducive to physical trapping or areas with the least amount of shear stress, consistent with hemodynamic or mechanical theories of metastasis.

This goal is made more challenging by the complexity of the mutational landscape of diseases, and is further compounded by the conformational plasticity of each variant where multiple conformations coexist. We focus here on the human MEK1 kinase, a vital component of the RAS/MAPK pathway in which mutations cause cancers and developmental disorders called RASopathies. We sought to explore how these mutations alter the human MEK1 kinase at atomic resolution by utilizing enhanced sampling simulations and free energy calculations. We computationally mapped the different conformational stabilities of individual mutated systems by delineating the free energy landscapes, and showed how this relates directly to experimentally quantified developmental transformation potentials of the mutations. We conclude that mutations leverage variations in the hydrogen bonding network associated with the conformational plasticity to progressively stabilize the active-like conformational state of the kinase while destabilizing the inactive-like state. The mutations alter residue-level internal molecular correlations by differentially prioritizing different conformational states, delineating the various modes of MEK1 activation reminiscent of a gear-shifting mechanism.

The heterogeneity of these tumors makes it difficult to standardize treatment. CDK 4/6 inhibitors are a family of targeted agents which limit cell cycle progression and have been shown to be upregulated in sarcomas. In the current preclinical study, we evaluated the effects of lerociclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, on pediatric sarcomas in vitro and in 3D bioprinted tumors. Methods: The effects of lerociclib on viability, proliferation, cell cycle, motility, and stemness were assessed in established sarcoma cell lines, U-2 OS and MG-63, as well as sarcoma patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). 3D printed biotumors of each of the U-2 OS, MG-63, and COA79 cells were utilized to study the effects of lerociclib on tumor growth ex vivo. Results: CDK 4/6, as well as the intermediaries retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and phosphorylated Rb were identified as targets in the four sarcoma cell lines. Lerociclib treatment induced cell cycle arrest, decreased proliferation, motility, and stemness of sarcoma cells. Treatment with lerociclib decreased sarcoma cell viability in both traditional 2D culture as well as 3D bioprinted microtumors. Conclusions: Inhibition of CDK 4/6 activity with lerociclib was efficacious in traditional 2D sarcoma cell culture as well as in 3D bioprints. Lerociclib holds promise and warrants further investigation as a novel therapeutic strategy for management of these heterogenous groups of tumors.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Restricted Access

We previously developed CHimeric IMmune Editing (CHIME), a CRISPR-Cas9 bone marrow delivery system for constitutive, ubiquitous deletion of single genes. Here we describe X-CHIME, four new CHIME-based systems for modular and rapid interrogation of gene function combinatorially (C-CHIME), inducibly (I-CHIME), lineage-specifically (L-CHIME) or sequentially (S-CHIME). We use C-CHIME and S-CHIME to assess the consequences of combined deletion of Ptpn1 and Ptpn2, an embryonic lethal gene pair, in adult mice. We find that constitutive deletion of both PTPN1 and PTPN2 leads to bone marrow hypoplasia and lethality, while inducible deletion after immune development leads to enteritis and lethality. These findings demonstrate that X-CHIME can be used for rapid mechanistic evaluation of genes in distinct in vivo contexts and that PTPN1 and PTPN2 have some functional redundancy important for viability in adult mice.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Restricted Access

Prior work has shown that brain cancers and metastases are densely infiltrated with anti-inflammatory, protumourigenic tumour-associated macrophages, but the role of brain-resident microglia remains controversial because they are challenging to discriminate from other tumour-associated macrophages. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, genetic and humanized mouse models, we specifically identify microglia and find that they play a distinct pro-inflammatory and tumour-suppressive role in BCBM. Animals lacking microglia show increased metastasis, decreased survival and reduced natural killer and T cell responses, showing that microglia are critical to promote anti-tumour immunity to suppress BCBM. We find that the pro-inflammatory response is conserved in human microglia, and markers of their response are associated with better prognosis in patients with BCBM. These findings establish an important role for microglia in anti-tumour immunity and highlight them as a potential immunotherapy target for brain metastasis.",Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Pending Annotation,Restricted Access
